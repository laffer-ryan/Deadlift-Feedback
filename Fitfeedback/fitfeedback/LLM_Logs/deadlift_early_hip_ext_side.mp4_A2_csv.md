Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: The task entails a comprehensive evaluation of a deadlift performance from a side view focusing on the mid-lift phase to full extension. I must analyze joint angles and their implications for effective pulling techniques, emphasizing the correlation between knee and hip extensions while ensuring the overall symmetry of joint movements.  

2. Key Steps: Firstly, I will assess the provided joint angle measurements and interpret their significance in relation to proper deadlift mechanics. Following that, I will outline observable deviations from ideal deadlift form based on my expertise. For each of the four checkpoints, I will detail the metrics involved, observations identifying issues, and specific recommendations for corrections.  

3. Approach to Challenges: If deviations in joint angles or form are significant, I may need to provide alternative corrective strategies to ensure the athlete can achieve proper form. I will draw on the knowledge that slight variations are expected due to real-time data capture, and I must focus on the most critical joint angles and their relationships to identify necessary corrections.  

4. Strategic Use of Tools: I will primarily use the available tool to draft a structured list of checkpoints related to the deadlift performance. I'll ensure that I categorize observations effectively and make precise recommendations for improvement based on professional standards.  

5. Expected Outcome: The outcome will be a detailed JSON list that encapsulates crucial observations and tailored recommendations for the athlete's mid-lift to full extension mechanics. This aligns with my goal of enhancing performance through improved technique and form, ultimately leading to safer and more effective lifting techniques.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
