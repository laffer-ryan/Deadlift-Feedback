Reasoning Plan:
1. Understand that the objective is to provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of a deadlift performance based on findings from two phases: setup and pull. I will evaluate the data from both phases to identify synergistic issues and common themes affecting performance. 

2. Key steps involved in completing the task: 
   - Extract significant observations and recommendations from both the setup and pull phases, ensuring to filter for the most impactful feedback. 
   - Synthesize the findings in a structured markdown format that is easy to read and understand by physical trainers and coaches. 
   - Ensure that all recommendations focus on improving performance and injury prevention, avoiding any fabrication of non-relevant findings. 
   - Strategically group the issues by phase and provide clear, actionable steps alongside any comments on accessory exercises only when limiting factors show a need for them.

3. Anticipate potential challenges, such as aligning the findings from both phases cohesively, ensuring that no key aspects are overlooked. However, my extensive experience allows me to navigate these complexities effectively. 

4. Utilize the processing power of the functions to create a well-formatted report. Given the nature of the task, I will not need to utilize the multi_tool_use function because I am consolidating findings from a single task, and the create_reasoning_plan will suffice to outline my approach. 

5. The expected outcome is a detailed, professional report that clearly communicates performance insights and corrective strategies, fully aligned with my goal of enhancing deadlift mechanics and reducing injury risk.

## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
The current deadlift performance presents several areas for improvement, notably in the setup and pull phases. The metrics indicate issues with knee tracking, shoulder alignment, and grip symmetry which can affect overall lift efficiency and introduce injury risks. Addressing these factors will lead to better lifting mechanics and performance.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Knee Positioning:** The normalised knee distance is too high (2.4086), suggesting excessive forward knee movement. This can lead to improper lifting mechanics.
- **Grip Symmetry:** The normalised wrist difference is significant (2.4770), indicating asymmetric grip positioning and potential for imbalances in force application.
- **Shoulder Alignment:** The left to right shoulder slope is unbalanced (0.0371), which may impact stability and overall posture at lift-off.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Tracking (Initial Lift):** There is an imbalanced extension (1.719) in the knee distance which can affect the vertical trajectory of the bar.
- **Shoulder Imbalance (Lift-off):** The shoulder slope (0.0539) suggests a slight forward lean, which could compromise effective lifting mechanics.
- **Lateral Deviation (Mid-lift):** Right knee lateral distance from the center (0.700) indicates lateral deviation that can compromise the lift’s balance.
- **Ankle Mobility (Full Extension):** The normalised ankle difference (1.876) suggests tightness in the calf muscles, hindering full extension and performance.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Maintain Proper Knee Tracking:** Focus on keeping paths vertical by ensuring the knees do not move excessively forward or laterally during the lift. 
- **Normalize Grip Width:** Adjust to achieve symmetrical grip positioning, helping distribute lifting force evenly across both sides.
- **Enhance Shoulder Stability:** Work on leveling shoulder alignment before lift-off and maintain a neutral spine throughout the lift.
- **Address Ankle Mobility Issues:** Incorporate mobility drills to enhance ankle flexibility, allowing for proper positioning and complete extension.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Knee Tracking Drills:** Utilize banded squats or step-ups to reinforce proper knee positioning during lifts.
- **Shoulder Mobilization Exercises:** Include movements such as shoulder dislocates or band pull-aparts to improve shoulder alignment.
- **Ankle Mobility Routine:** Engage in calf stretches and ankle mobility drills to enhance flexibility and range of motion, improving overall lifting mechanics.

By addressing the highlighted issues and focusing on the given recommendations, the lifter should see improved performance in their deadlift with reduced risk of injury. Each area of focus contributes to the overall effectiveness and safety of the lift."

**Movement Summary:**  
In this analysis, we observed the deadlift performance from a left view perspective, focusing on the setup and pull phases. The initial setup phase showed certain inefficiencies in joint positioning that impacted the subsequent pulling phase. Notably, the shoulder, knee, and hip angles require adjustments to enhance overall lift efficiency and stability.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Shoulder Distance**: The normalized shoulder distance is higher than ideal, suggesting a forward lean which could impair leverage.
  - **Recommendation**: Retract the shoulder blades and lift the chest to improve stability and force transfer.
- **Knee Positioning**: The knees are positioned too far forward relative to the bar, potentially reducing hip engagement at the lift-off point.
  - **Recommendation**: Position the knees slightly back while maintaining a neutral spine to utilize the posterior chain effectively.
- **Knee Imbalance**: Asymmetrical lateral knee distance, with the right knee further out, indicates potential imbalance.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure symmetrical positioning by pushing both knees outward and maintaining even weight distribution.

**Pull Phase**
- **Initial Knee Angle**: The left knee starts at 113.14 degrees, potentially limiting force generation.
  - **Recommendation**: Lower to around 100 degrees at lift-off for more effective force application.
- **Hip Engagement**: A hip angle of 89.91 degrees suggests incomplete engagement affecting lift efficiency.
  - **Recommendation**: Aim for a hip angle between 80-85 degrees during torso progression to enhance power.
- **Knee Extension**: Reduced knee extension at 128.60 degrees could limit upward drive.
  - **Recommendation**: Extend the knees earlier, targeting 110 to 120 degrees for optimal performance.
- **Full Hip Extension**: Achieved but without optimal posterior chain tension.
  - **Recommendation**: Fully engage glutes and hamstrings to stabilize and maximize power output.

**Overall Recommendations**
- Correct shoulder posture at setup will enhance leverage and stability, setting a better foundation for the pull.
- Symmetrical knee positioning ensures balanced force distribution, crucial for lift efficiency.
- Better hip and knee angles in the pull phase will improve force application and lift smoothness.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **For Shoulder Positioning**: Scapular retraction exercises such as face pulls or band pull-aparts.
- **For Hip Engagement**: Romanian deadlifts or hip thrusts to strengthen posterior chain muscles and ensure complete extension.
- **For Knee Stability**: Single-leg squats or lunges to address imbalances and encourage equal engagement on both sides.

Reasoning Plan:
## Understanding of the Task
This task requires synthesizing detailed biomechanical analysis from the deadlift setup and pull phases, verifying insights, and compiling a comprehensive report. Given the complexity of movement mechanics, linking errors in setup with subsequent pull issues requires an integration of observations to provide cohesive feedback on a lifter's form.

## Key Steps to Complete the Task
1. **Review and Verification:**
   - Verify the observations and recommendations provided for the setup and pull phases by cross-referencing them with known ideal biomechanics of the deadlift.
   - Assess whether the identified metrics align with expected performance standards and whether the feedback is practical and scientifically sound.

2. **Integration of Insights:**
   - Connect identified setup issues with potential impact on the pull phase.
   - Evaluate how setup modifications directly affect pull efficiency and safety.

3. **Feedback Compilation:**
   - Organize verified and integrated observations into a structured report.
   - Ensure clarity, relevance, and usefulness of feedback with actionable steps.

4. **Accessory Exercises Recommendations:**
   - Based on identified limiting factors, suggest targeted accessory exercises to address specific weaknesses or improve overall form and strength.

## Challenges and Approaches
- **Challenge of Misalignment in Insights:** Discrepancies in setup and pull phase findings need careful alignment which can be addressed by evaluating cause-effect relationships between setup form and pull mechanics.
- **Generating Comprehensive Recommendations:** Given the variabilities in performance, providing comprehensive yet specific feedback demands experience-driven insights.

## Strategic Use of Tools
- **Multi-tool Evaluation Method:** Utilize cross-verification between tools deadlift_setup_trainer and deadlift_pull_trainer, confirming and elaborating insights, which makes the final analysis robust and reliable.
- **Structured Output through Markdown:** Implementing markdown allows for clear presentation of complex data ensuring that findings, recommendations, and suggested exercises are categorized and communicated effectively.

## Expected Outcome

**Movement Summary:**  
The deadlift performance showed inefficiencies primarily in the lift-off and pull phases. Adjustments in setup posture can directly improve pull mechanics and ensure a safer, more effective lift.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Left Knee Angle**: At lift-off, the knee angle is at 113.14 degrees, which is farther from the ideal 90 degrees. This can lead to inefficient hip engagement and increased strain on the knees.
  - **Recommendation**: Bend the knees more at the setup to achieve a knee angle closer to 90 degrees. This will help engage the posterior chain more effectively and provide a stronger base for lifting.
  
- **Left Hip Angle**: The recorded hip angle of 55.30 degrees indicates hips are too high. This can cause the bar's weight distribution to be unfavorable, increasing the likelihood of lift failure.
  - **Recommendation**: Lower the hips to bring them in line with the shoulders and closer to the bar, facilitating better force transfer from the legs through the torso.
  
- **Bar Distance from Body**: The bar is 8.50 cm away from the body at lift-off, leading to imbalanced lifts.
  - **Recommendation**: Maintain the bar closer to the shins by channeling the pull through the heels, ensuring the bar path remains near the body’s center of mass.

**Pull Phase**
- **Left Hip Angle**: At torso progress of 140 degrees, the hip angle is 116.41 degrees, indicating suboptimal hip extension for force transfer.
  - **Recommendation**: Enhance glute engagement and drive hips forward to achieve a more effective extension near 140 degrees, aiding in efficient force application.
  
- **Left Knee Angle**: At torso progress of 150 degrees, knee angle is 157 degrees, suggesting incomplete knee extension.
  - **Recommendation**: Push the knees back during the torso rise to ensure full knee extension and optimal utilization of the posterior chain.
  
- **Bar Distance from Body at Full Extension**: With the bar at 17.24 cm from the body in final lift phases, this suggests inefficient lifting mechanics.
  - **Recommendation**: Concentrate on keeping the bar aligned with the midfoot throughout the lift, which will improve stability and enhance the drive during the peak lifting phase.

**Overall Recommendations**
- Ensure a synchronized start by integrating knee and hip extension. Begin with closer attention to initial setup posture to enhance all subsequent phases.
- Maintain a firm grip and tight back to stabilize the torso and maximize posterior chain engagement.
- Practice movements that foster hip and knee coordination with adherence to optimal angles.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Romanian Deadlifts**: These will help in strengthening hamstrings and glutes while teaching proper hip hinge mechanics.
- **Hip Thrusts**: To enhance glute engagement, which is vital for achieving full hip extension.
- **Leg Press**: To encourage stronger knee extension capability and drive.

Through these adjustments and exercises, your deadlift performance can become safer, more technically proficient, and more powerful. Remember to gradually incorporate these changes, allowing your body to adapt correctly to improved techniques."

", status="completed", output="## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
Overall, the lifter demonstrated a technically challenging deadlift cycle. Notable areas of concern included bar path drift, less than optimal joint angles at key phases, and insufficient posterior chain engagement. Making specific adjustments will enhance performance, safety, and efficiency during the lift.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Bar Distance from Body:** At lift-off, the bar starts optimally at 8.50 cm away from the shins but drifts drastically to 43.54 cm early in the pull. This points to initial setup issues that impact subsequent phases.
- **Left Hip Angle:** The initial left hip angle is 55.30 degrees, highlighting excessive forward lean. This can lead to compromised spinal alignment and increased injury risk.

**Pull Phase**
- **Left Knee Angle:** By the 140-degree checkpoint, the left knee angle of 158.19 degrees indicates limited extension not conducive to maximum strength transfer. Ideally, a closer target to 170 degrees is advised.
- **Left Hip Angle:** The recorded 128.60 degrees reflect limited hip extension, hindering full posterior chain recruitment.
- **Posterior Chain Engagement:** At the 160-degree checkpoint, engagement angle reached 155.60 degrees. Better utilization of hamstrings and glutes is necessary for effective force application.
- **Bar Distance from Body at Full Extension:** The bar remains 17.24 cm off at full extension, suggesting possible inefficiency and decreased lift power.

**Overall Recommendations**
- Keep the bar as close to the body as possible, minimizing drift, to ensure mechanics align optimally with the midfoot.
- Actively engage the posterior chain, focusing on a balanced recruitment of the glutes and hamstrings from the start of the lift.
- Synchronize hip and knee extension, aiming for more complete extension to allow effective force transmission at the ground contact.
- Practice lighter lifts to reinforce correct setup and subsequent pulling mechanics. This improves muscle memory without taxing current technique capabilities.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Romanian Deadlifts:** To enhance posterior chain development and promote hip hinge patterns.
- **Goblet Squats:** To assist lifters in improving knee and hip extension coordination.
- **Planks or Lateral Cable Rows:** For core strengthening, facilitating better spinal alignment control.
- **Hip Thrusts:** To specifically target glute and hip extension to achieve full extension during deadlifts.

By addressing these focal points and engaging in suggested exercises, the lifter can improve their deadlift technique significantly, boosting lift efficacy while reducing injury potential."
