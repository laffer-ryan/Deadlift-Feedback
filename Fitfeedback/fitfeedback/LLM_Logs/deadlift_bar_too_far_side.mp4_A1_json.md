Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the Task: I will analyze deadlift performance data focusing specifically on the initial phases of the deadlift: setup, liftoff, and initial pull from a left side view perspective. I will pay close attention to joint angles and relevant metrics while disregarding any front plane asymmetries or joint distances as per the provided context.

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task: 
   - I will evaluate the collected data based on joint angles and their implications on the overall deadlift mechanics.  
   - Identify specific checkpoint metrics associated with the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases, which include angles like hip flexion, knee flexion, and spinal alignment.  
   - Develop observations based on these angles and suggest targeted recommendations for improvement in each area.

3. Approach for Challenges: Challenges may arise with data irregularities due to slight variations from the YOLO model inference. I will remain vigilant to ensure corrections address even nuanced deviations and maintain a focus on safety and effectiveness.

4. Using Available Tools: I will utilize the multi_tool_use.parallel method to run multiple evaluations simultaneously based on the performance data. The expected evaluation will yield concrete metrics with corresponding recommendations for each of the defined checkpoints (1 to 3). 

5. Expected Outcome: The result will be a detailed JSON list containing observations and actionable recommendations based on the analysis of the angles and distances from the deadlift performance data. This aligns with my goal of providing expert guidance to refine the initial phases of the deadlift for better performance and safety.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
