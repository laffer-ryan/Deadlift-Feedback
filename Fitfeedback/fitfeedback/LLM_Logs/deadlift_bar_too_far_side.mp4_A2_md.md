Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: My task is to evaluate a deadlift from a side-view perspective by focusing specifically on Phase 2 (mid-lift to full extension), using joint angle and distance metrics for analysis. I will assess the pull mechanics with a focus on knee and hip extension alignment, aiming to identify any deviations from optimal form based on the provided metrics. 

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**: 
   - Analyze the joint angles relevant to the pull phase: hip angle and knee angle. 
   - Interpret the significance of these angles in relation to biomechanics to identify whether they fall within optimal ranges. 
   - Record observations on how well the lifter is extending their joints in the lift. 
   - Compile and synthesize these observations into bullet points that detail checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations. 

3. **Approaching Challenges**: I am aware that slight variations in the metrics might arise from YOLO model inference, which requires a keen eye to recognize acceptable ranges of performance. I will keep in mind common mistakes during the pull such as rounding of the back, misalignment between knee and hip extension, and engage in detailed analysis to make necessary recommendations.

4. **Using the Available Tools**: I will examine the statistical data that I receive from the analysis and compile the findings into a JSON format. The analysis will focus strictly on the pull phase without concern for frontal plane asymmetries or joint distances, as these are not available from this perspective. The final output will consist of recommendations formatted in a structured way. 

5. **Expected Outcome**: The outcome will be a comprehensive list of recommendations focusing on optimizing the pull phase of the deadlift to ensure safe and effective lifting techniques. This aligns with my goal to analyze and provide corrective feedback for common issues.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
