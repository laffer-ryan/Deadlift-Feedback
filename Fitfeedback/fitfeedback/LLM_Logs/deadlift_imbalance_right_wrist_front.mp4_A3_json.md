Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: As a deadlift specialist, I recognize the importance of analyzing both the setup and pulling phases of the deadlift. The goal is to compile the findings from the two agents, focusing on the most impactful feedbacks that can enhance performance and reduce injury risk. This analysis will result in a comprehensive report that highlights key areas for improvement and specific recommendations.

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:
   - I will review and compare the findings from both the setup and pull phases thoroughly.
   - I will identify issues that reoccur in both analyses to pinpoint critical areas of concern.
   - Synthesize the feedback into structured markdown sections for clarity.
   - Formulate clear, actionable recommendations based on the findings, tailored to improve form and efficiency.
   - Suggest auxiliary exercises that target identified weaknesses if applicable.

3. Challenges and Approaches: Potential challenges include navigating disparate findings or conflicting observations. To address this, I will closely assess the context of each feedback point, focusing on those corroborated by multiple dimensions of analysis. I will prioritize findings that affect the overall lift integrity and injury prevention.

4. Tools to Use: I will use the functions of creating an integrated feedback report through markdown formatting, running multi-tool functions if necessary to streamline the input of observations and recommendations into the report. 

5. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a clear, structured report summarizing the deadlift performance, highlighting areas of improvement sorted by phase, along with tailored recommendations and accessory exercises if needed. This report will serve as a valuable resource for client guidance and performance enhancement.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift

**Movement Summary:**  
The deadlift performance shows significant areas of concern in both the setup and pulling phases, presenting a risk for inefficiencies and potential injuries. Key focus areas include the bar's distance from the body, knee positioning, and shoulder alignment. Correcting these will improve the overall lift mechanics and safety.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Bar Distance from Body:** The bar is positioned 41.96 cm away from the body, which is significantly above the recommended range. This can lead to lower back strain and decreased leverage.
- **Knee Position:** The normalized knee distance is measured at 2.02, indicating that the knees are too far forward of the bar path, which compromises hip hinge mechanics.
- **Shoulder Alignment:** The normalized shoulder distance is 1.37, suggesting the shoulders are misaligned over the bar, which can impair force transfer during the lift.

**Pull Phase**
- **Shoulder Positioning:** There is a slight positive slope (higher left shoulder), indicating asymmetrical shoulder engagement which can affect balance and lifting efficiency.
- **Narrow Stance:** The normalized knee distance at 60% lift progression may indicate a slightly narrow stance, which could risk knee caving.
- **Weight Distribution:** At 80% lift progress, there is an imbalance with the right knee positioned closer to the center than the left, indicating a right weight shift.
- **Ankle Flexion:** The right ankle is higher than the left during the full extension phase, which can affect stability and power output.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Adjust Bar Positioning:** Work on reducing the distance between the bar and body at setup to facilitate a more upright torso position, improving mechanics.
- **Knee and Hip Coordination:** Focus on keeping knees back during setup to ensure effective hip engagement. This can help rectify both the setup and pull phase issues.
- **Ensure Symmetrical Setup:** Emphasize equal shoulder alignment at lift-off to prevent imbalances during lifting and enhance symmetry.
- **Stance Width Adjustment:** Widen the stance slightly to enhance stability and mitigate risk of knee caving.
- **Weight Distribution Focus:** Pay attention to even weight distribution across both legs, especially during the initial pull and throughout the lift.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Hip Hinge Drills:** Incorporate kettlebell swings or Romanian deadlifts to strengthen the posterior chain and improve hip hinge mechanics.
- **Ankle Mobility Work:** Use calf stretches and mobility drills to improve ankle flexibility, aiding in better positioning and stability during lifts.
- **Balanced Shoulder Exercises:** Implement unilateral shoulder press or rows to address shoulder imbalances and improve stability throughout the lift. 
- **Squat Variations:** Practice wide-stance squats to develop strength and stability in the knee and hip areas, reinforcing proper joint alignment during deadlifts.

By addressing the identified areas through both modifications to lifting technique and supplementary exercises, the lifter can enhance performance while minimizing injury risk, leading to a more effective and safe deadlift."
