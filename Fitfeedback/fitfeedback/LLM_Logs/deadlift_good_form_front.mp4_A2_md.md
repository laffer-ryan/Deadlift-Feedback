Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: As a Deadlift Expert, I will focus on analyzing the mid-lift phase of a deadlift captured from a frontal view camera. The emphasis will be on evaluating the inter-joint distances, slopes, and their significance during the pull phase until full extension. I will provide a detailed assessment of checkpoints related to pull mechanics, knee extension, and hip extension without considering joint angles since they are not part of the input metrics provided from a frontal view. 

2. Key steps to complete the task: 
   - Review the provided deadlift performance data focusing on the distances and related metrics pertinent to the pull phase. 
   - Analyze the movement for symmetry and alignment between knee and hip extension during the mid-lift. 
   - Identify major issues in form based on the distances between critical joints and any deviations in slopes that could indicate improper mechanics. 
   - Formulate corrective recommendations based on biomechanical principles to enhance the athlete's performance and safety.

3. Challenges that might arise: I may encounter variations in metrics due to the nature of the data collection process from the YOLO model inference. I will need to interpret these anomalies and ensure that my recommendations are clear and actionable despite these fluctuations. 

4. Tools usage: I will utilize the functions available for processing the evaluation and generating a structured JSON list of findings. I will run the analysis and recommendations on the joint distances and slopes once I have identified key observations. 

5. Expected outcome: Upon completion, I anticipate obtaining a structured, detailed JSON output with key checkpoints related to the mid-lift phase of the deadlift, alongside observations and recommendations that focus primarily on enhancing pull mechanics, knee and hip extension. This would align well with my goal of improving the deadlifting technique for the athlete, ensuring safety and maximizing performance.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
