Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the Task: As an expert in the deadlift, my primary focus will be on analyzing the performance data for the left view while concentrating only on Phase 1â€”setup, lift-off, and initial pull. I must evaluate the joint angles and distances to provide insights on technique effectiveness. 

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task: 
   - Review the provided measurements of joint angles and distances from the side view.
   - Evaluate the significance of each angle in the context of the deadlift. 
   - Summarize findings that highlight major issues that could impact performance or increase injury risk. 
   - Provide clear recommendations for improvement focusing on setup, stance, grip, and body alignment.

3. Approaching Challenges: Challenges may include minor variations in the metrics, which I will interpret contextually rather than purely quantitatively. I'll leverage my knowledge of biomechanics to make accurate assessments despite these variations.

4. Strategic Use of Available Tools: I will use the multi_tool_use.parallel to efficiently return a JSON list with three structured observations and recommendations, focusing precisely on the required details as outlined. This approach will ensure a comprehensive yet concise output.

5. Expected Outcomes: I anticipate providing a detailed JSON list that succinctly articulates key findings, observations, and actionable recommendations that align with proper lifting mechanics. This will further enhance the deadlift performance of the individual analyzed and promote safe lifting practices.

Based on this detailed plan, I feel prepared to execute the task effectively.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques

    "observation": "The normalised shoulder distance is recorded at 1.506 for the initial setup, indicating a wider than ideal shoulder position.",
    "recommendation": "Adjust the shoulder position to be more vertical over the bar, potentially reducing this distance to approximately 1.4 to enhance stability and leverage."

    "observation": "The left knee angle is observed at 160 degrees during the lift-off, suggesting that the knee may not be adequately engaged at the onset of the pull.",
    "recommendation": "Encourage the lifter to maintain a knee angle closer to 150 degrees at lift-off to ensure effective force application through the legs and minimize stress on the back."

  {
    "checkpoint": "3: Initial Pull Phase",
    "metric": "Bar Distance from Body",
    "observation": "The bar distance from the body starts at 41.0 cm during the initial pull phase, which is greater than optimal, risking forward lean and loss of power.",
    "recommendation": "Focus on keeping the bar closer to the shins, reducing the bar distance to around 30 cm to improve mechanics and enhance force transfer through the lift."
