Reasoning Plan:
1. **Gather and Analyze Performance Data**: Collect front view performance data focusing on key points in the deadlift such as joint angles (ankles, knees, hips, spine), bar path, and muscle activation at each phase. Tools like video analysis software can be useful here. 

2. **Integrate Findings from Deadlift Setup Trainer**: Utilize the performance data to identify foot placement, hip hinge function, back positioning, and grip strength errors as identified by the deadlift_setup_trainer. 

3. **Integrate Findings from Deadlift Pull Trainer**: Analyze the data with respect to findings from the deadlift_pull_trainer including aspects like barbell trajectory, acceleration, and upper body alignment to identify inefficiencies. 

4. **Cross-Verification of Findings**: Compare the insights from both setup and pull trainers with the raw performance data to ensure consistency in identified issues. Utilize summary statistics and visualization tools to confirm any correlations effectively. 

5. **Develop Comprehensive Feedback Report**: Compile detailed feedback that integrates insights from the setup and pull phases. Include specific corrections and alternatives for exercises that strengthen the limiting muscles based on the findings from the performance data. 

6. **Provide Recommendations**: Suggest tailored strategies for enhancement including mobility drills, strength exercises targeting weak muscle groups, and specific practice drills to enhance deadlift mechanics further. 

Tool Usage Strategy: 
- The `functions.create_reasoning_plan` tool is used to refine my execution strategy clearly before task execution. 
- I will follow this up with data analysis directly through the `functions.create_reasoning_plan` once I have the data from setup and pull trainers, ensuring precise focus on the necessary elements for an effective integration. 

Overall, this plan ensures a thorough analysis of the deadlift with a focus on coherence between the setup and pull phases for comprehensive improvements. 

Based on the completeness of this refined plan, I assess that I am ready to proceed with the task execution directly.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift

**Movement Summary:**  
The analysis indicates key areas in both the setup and pull phases that require attention to enhance performance and minimize injury risk. The lifter displays a generally solid foundation; however, specific deviations in joint alignment and asymmetries could hinder efficiency in the lift-off and increase the potential for strain during the pull.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Shoulder Distance**: The shoulder distance is wider than optimal, affecting stability and force generation.
- **Wrist Positioning**: Significant asymmetry in wrist positioning could lead to uneven force distribution and potential discrepancies in the bar path.
- **Knee Alignment**: The left knee is positioned lateral to the centerline, indicating potential alignment issues that could affect the lifting mechanics.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Alignment**: Although the initial positioning shows symmetrical knee distances, deviations during the lift can lead to lateral shifts which reduce force transfer efficiency.
- **Wrist Positioning**: Persisting wrist asymmetry observed during the lift progression indicates a need for better bar path control to avoid injury and improve performance.
- **Knee Dominance**: The shift in left knee dominance during ascent indicates imbalance, potentially jeopardizing stability.
- **Ankle Positioning**: Inclination of the right ankle at full extension suggests misalignment that could affect the overall lifting trajectory.

**Overall Recommendations**
- Focus on maintaining parallel alignment of wrists and knees throughout the setup and pull phases to enhance overall stability and power transfer.
- Implement cues for knee tracking to ensure they remain over the toes during the entire movement, addressing lateral shifts.
- Prioritize equal engagement of both sides of the body to prevent dominance and improve overall balance during the lift.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Knee Alignment and Stability**: 
   - **Front Squats**: Help improve knee tracking and strengthen the quadriceps.
   - **Single-leg Deadlifts**: Focus on bilateral coordination and balance while engaging stabilizing muscles more effectively.
  
- **Wrist and Grip Strength**: 
   - **Farmers Walks**: Enhance grip strength and improve wrist positioning through dynamic loading.
   - **Grip Trainer Exercises**: Utilizes various grip strength tools (like hand grippers) to build symmetrical forearm strength.

- **Ankle Mobility**: 
   - **Calf Raises and Ankle Dorsiflexion Stretching**: Improve ankle flexibility and support proper alignment during the lift.

This comprehensive report aims to provide the lifter with a clear direction for technique improvements, alongside supplementary exercises that will address the identified limitations for enhanced deadlift performance."
