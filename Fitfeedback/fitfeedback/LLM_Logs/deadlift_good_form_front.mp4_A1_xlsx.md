Reasoning Plan:
1. Gather and organize the provided deadlift performance data focusing on Phase 1 (setup, lift-off, initial pull) for the front view. 
2. Evaluate stance width and grip position by analyzing the distance measurements to ensure proper alignment and measure the distance between feet and hands relative to shoulder width. 
3. Analyze angle measurements for the hips, knees, and spine at the initial setup to identify any misalignments that could indicate poor positioning. 
4. Compare collected angle data against established optimal ranges (e.g., hip angle should be around 45 degrees, spine neutral) to determine deviations. 
5. Establish key metrics for ideal setup including proper stance width (shoulder-width) and grip (medium to neutral). 
6. For the lift-off, assess whether the lift begins with adequate activation of the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings) without premature hip rise or back rounding, specifically regarding the hip-knee angle at lift-off. 
7. Identify corrective measures needed for observed issues such as adjusting stance width, grip, or aligning the spine correctly during setup. 
8. Formulate a corrective action plan that focuses on muscle engagement, cueing for proper loading through the heels, and stabilization of the spine. 
9. Highlight the importance of biomechanical efficiency and safety, ensuring recommendations enhance performance without risking injury. 
10. Draft conclusive action steps for readily implementable training changes, emphasizing repetitions of proper mechanics in practice. 

Tool usage strategy: I will not use any tools for data evaluation but will rely on my expertise to draw insights from the provided performance data, using biomechanical principles learned throughout my career. I will leverage analytical skills without the need for automated functions. 

I believe this plan is comprehensive and addresses the vital areas of setup, lift-off, and initial pull, ensuring that the assessment is precise and clear. By focusing on what metrics to observe and how to adjust based on deviations from those metrics, this plan can lead to effective coaching recommendations for improved performance and safety.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
