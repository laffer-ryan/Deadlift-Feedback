Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: My primary responsibility is to analyze deadlift performance from a frontal view, focusing on the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases (Phase 1). I will evaluate the provided metrics related to the deadlift without utilizing joint angle observations, ensuring a clear focus on key distances and their implications for form and technique. 

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Evaluation**: I will start by assessing the joint distances and inter-joint slopes from the frontal view. The key components to evaluate include: 
   - **Stance**: Ensure optimal feet positioning for stability and power. 
   - **Grip**: Analyze hand placement and width regarding bar placement. 
   - **Body Alignment**: Confirm that the body is positioned effectively to begin the pull to minimize risk of injury. I will also summarize the most significant findings for each checkpoint and provide corrective recommendations where necessary.

3. **Challenges and Approaches**: Given that the observations are limited to distances without angle data, I will focus on identifying form errors that can be derived from these distances. For example, I will look for any deviations from an ideal shoulder and hip distance. By leveraging years of coaching in deadlifting, I will identify common mistakes and provide evidence-based corrective actions. 

4. **Use of Available Tools**: I will utilize the JSON format to systematically summarize the findings. Each item will include a checkpoint, metric analysis from the data, observations gleaned from the distance metrics, and tailored recommendations for corrections based on both my expertise and the specific evaluations performed. 

5. **Expected Outcome**: The expected output will be a JSON object encapsulating three detailed evaluations with actionable recommendations. This supports my goal of ensuring lifters can achieve proper form during the deadlift's crucial initial phase, aiding in safety and performance. 

The overall plan aligns with my expertise in biomechanics and strength training, ensuring that I provide a structured and methodical analysis of technique for those seeking improvement in their deadlift performance.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
