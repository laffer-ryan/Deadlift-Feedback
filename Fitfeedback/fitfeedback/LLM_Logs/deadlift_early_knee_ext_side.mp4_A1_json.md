Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: The task is to analyze deadlift performance data from a left (side) view, specifically focusing on the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases (checkpoints 1 to 3). The evaluation will center around joint angles and their implications for proper technique. My expertise gives me the framework to assess these aspects critically, ensuring they align with safe and effective deadlift performance. 

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:
   - Analyze the provided joint angles and distances for the side view data.
   - Identify critical checkpoints in the deadlift setup, liftoff, and initial pull, focusing on stance, grip, and body alignment.
   - Review joint angles for both knees and hips, as they are crucial during these phases and determine lift-off efficacy.
   - Summarize the findings outlining three key observations tied to specific metrics that can aid in making recommendations for improvement. 

3. Approach to Challenges: Challenges may arise from the interpretation of slight deviations in the metrics since the data is subject to YOLO model inference variability. My extensive experience allows me to differentiate between acceptable variations and significant errors in form. 

4. Use of Available Tools: I will utilize the functions provided to create a structured response detailing the observations on joint angles and recommendations based on those observations, ensuring that all points cover the necessary checkpoints. 

5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal: The expected outcome is a detailed JSON list that captures essential information about the deadlift setup phase, including checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations for each item. This aligns with my goal of providing actionable feedback that facilitates optimal deadlift performance and safety.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques

        "observation": "The bar is too far from the body (approximately 41.96 degrees), which can lead to inefficiency and increased strain on the lower back during the lift-off phase.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the bar is positioned closer to the shins at the start of the lift. This will allow for a more vertical torso position and reduce strain on the back."

        "metric": "left_knee_angle",
        "observation": "The left knee angle is recorded at 125.04 degrees, indicating that the knees are positioned too far forward relative to the barbell, which can cause instability and a compromised lift-off.",
        "recommendation": "Adjust the setup to create a more vertical shin angle. The knees should not travel excessively forward beyond the bar; instead, start with a slight knee bend while maintaining hip elevation."

        "metric": "left_hip_angle",
        "observation": "The left hip angle is 94.68 degrees, suggesting that the hips are too low in relation to the bar, which compromises leverage and strength during the initial pull.",
        "recommendation": "Elevate the hips slightly in the starting position to establish a stronger pulling angle. Aim for a hip angle closer to 45-60 degrees for optimal biomechanical advantage."
