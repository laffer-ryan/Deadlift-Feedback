Reasoning Plan:
1. **Data Review and Analysis**: I will first obtain the deadlift performance data specifically focusing on the left view for Phase 1 (checkpoints 1 to 3). This will require detailed distance and angle measurements for joints involved, particularly the hips, knees, and shoulders to ensure proper alignment during the setup and lift-off. 

2. **Biomechanical Evaluation**: Upon receiving the data, I will analyze the biomechanics of the lifter's stance, grip, and alignment during the setup and initial pull phases. I will look for specific deviations from ideal form, such as hip height relative to the bar, knee position, and shoulder alignment. 

3. **Identification of Key Issues**: Depending on the analysis, I will identify any major issues with form and technique from the provided angles and distances that may hinder performance or increase injury risk. This will include evaluating joint angles that should ideally be present, as well as any signs of common errors like excessive rounding or excessive arching of the back.

4. **Formulation of Recommendations**: Based on the identified issues, I'll formulate specific recommendations to correct the setup such as adjusting stance width and foot angle, grip width, and ensuring proper spine alignment. Recommendations will include drills for enhancing body positioning and technique to improve the initial pull and lift-off.

5. **Feedback Structure**: I will structure the feedback in an understandable way, ensuring that it is clear to the practitioner what steps they need to take to improve. The recommendations will be prioritized based on their impact on performance and safety. 

In terms of tool usage strategy, the most appropriate tool is the `functions.create_reasoning_plan`, as it allows for a detailed breakdown of my thought process and ensures that I cover all critical aspects of the analysis systematically. 

After these steps are completed, I can proceed to receive and analyze the measured data efficiently and accurately.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
