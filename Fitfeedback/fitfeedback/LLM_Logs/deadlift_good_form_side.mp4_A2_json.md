Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the Task: As a Deadlift Expert specializing in mid-lift techniques, my task involves analyzing performance data specific to Phase 2 (mid-lift) of the deadlift from a side view, using joint angles and their metrics to evaluate form and technique. This entails focusing on knee and hip extension while avoiding frontal plane asymmetries.

4. Strategic Tool Use: I will use the multi_tool_use.parallel function to generate a detailed JSON list with 4 bullet points focusing on checkpoint, metric, observation, and recommendation. I will ensure the data I analyze is strictly from the side-view, avoiding frontal plane issues as instructed.

5. Expected Outcome: I expect to produce a clear, concise evaluation of the lifter's technique along with practical and actionable recommendations to correct identified issues in the pull phase. This aligns with my goal of enhancing the safety and efficacy of the deadlift through focused guidance on joint extension mechanics.

Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the task from my professional perspective involves analyzing the deadlift performance data captured from a side view, focusing specifically on Phase 2 (mid-lift to full extension). I need to evaluate joint angles (hips, knees) and their significance on the pull mechanics of the deadlift. The goal is to provide qualitative recommendations to improve form and technique based on my expertise in biomechanics and the interplay of hip and knee extensions.

2. Key steps in completing this task include:
   - Comprehensive evaluation of joint angles and their implications in the deadlift performance.
   - Identifying discrepancies and deviations in the pull phase mechanics based on the left-side view collected data.
   - Making observations and recommendations based on the specified criteria.

3. Challenges might arise from subtle variations in the metrics due to the YOLO model inference. To address this, I will reconcile the observed angles against ideal biomechanical values and adjust my recommendations accordingly. Moreover, I will take note of any repeated trends that indicate a systematic issue with the lift technique.

4. I will strategically use the tools available by calling the evaluation function to analyze joint angles and generate actionable checkpoints. The function will help in rounding up observations into the expected detailed JSON bullet points format outlining my analysis and recommendations based on joint mechanics.

5. The expected outcome is a comprehensive evaluation in a structured JSON format focusing on pull mechanics and joint behaviors throughout the deadlift. This aligns with my primary goal of enhancing performance and ensuring safety during lifts through precise technical adjustments and coaching advice.

Reasoning Plan:
### Refined Plan for Evaluating Deadlift Performance Data

1. **Understanding of Task**: I will analyze performance data of a deadlift from a side (left) view, concentrating on Phase 2, which encompasses the mid-lift to full extension mechanics. I will apply my knowledge of biomechanics to evaluate knee and hip joint angles and detect deviations that might hinder safe and effective lifts.

2. **Key Steps**:
    - **Joint Angle Assessment**: Review the angle measurements for the knee and hip joints during the mid-lift phase. I will focus on extension angles for both joints, ensuring they fall within the optimal range for effective force transfer.
    - **Distance Measurements**: Analyze vertical distances from the ground to the knee and hip joint at various points of the lift to evaluate symmetry and the overall body position.
    - **Biomechanical Observations**: Document specific observations related to joint alignment, symmetry, and overall body mechanics. This will include looking out for rounding of the back or excessive knee movement.
    - **Document Findings**: Compile a detailed summary of the observations, metric comparisons to optimal ranges, potential areas for improvement, and specific recommendations targeting knee and hip extension.
    
3. **Approach to Challenges**: I will consider variations that may occur due to individual body mechanics (e.g., anthropometry, flexibility). My analysis will include adjustments tailored to these factors, ensuring that the recommendations are both relevant and practical.

4. **Strategic Use of Tools**:
    - **functions.create_reasoning_plan**: This tool will be used first to formalize the reasoning behind my analysis process. By inputting a structured plan, I will clarify the methodology before diving into data analysis.
    - **multi_tool_use.parallel**: This will follow once I finalize the plan. With this function, I aim to gather and draw insights from the performance data simultaneously, leading to a cohesive analysis already framed by the earlier established plan.

5. **Expected Outcome**: Upon completing the steps outlined, I anticipate producing:
    - A summary report detailing the analysis based on the deadlift performance data.
    - Four bullet points highlighting:
        - Key checkpoints (joint angles and distances at significant phases),
        - Notable observations regarding technique,
        - Major deviations from ideal form,
        - Customized recommendations for correction focusing on hip and knee extensions.

### Conclusion
After refining my plan, I feel I have encompassed the necessary steps and considerations for a thorough analysis.
