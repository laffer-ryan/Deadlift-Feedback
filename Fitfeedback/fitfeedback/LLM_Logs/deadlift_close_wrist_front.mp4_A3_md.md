Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding the Task:** I will integrate performance data from the setup and pull phases of the deadlift to create a structured analysis report focusing on technique and efficiency improvements. The data includes observations and recommendations from two different phases of the lift, and I will filter through those to extract the most impactful insights.   

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  
   - Analyze findings from the setup phase, highlighting issues related to shoulder width and knee positioning.  
   - Review the pull phase data, emphasizing knee tracking, symmetry in arm positioning, and overall lift execution.  
   - Combine these findings while ensuring I focus on the most critical issues affecting performance and injury risk.  
   - Structure the report with clear headings for ease of understanding, ensuring actionable recommendations are prioritized.  

3. **Approach to Challenges:** Given that the findings from both phases can be interrelated, I will ensure that I clearly delineate which phase each recommendation pertains to. If contradictory data arises, I will prioritize findings based on their relevance to overall lift performance and the risk of injury.  

4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools:** I will use the **multi_tool_use.parallel** to handle parallel feedback analysis if needed, but this task can also be accomplished through manual processing as I'm familiar with both data sets. Importantly, I will synthesize in markdown format to align with the expected reporting structure.  

5. **Expected Outcome:** The report will succinctly outline the lifter's strengths and areas for improvement. It will offer clear recommendations for technical adjustments and accessory exercises if limiting factors are identified. This provides a roadmap for the lifter to improve their performance, enhance safety, and ultimately achieve their lifting goals.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift
", status="completed", output="## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
This analysis examines the overall deadlift performance, with a focus on the setup and pull phases. The feedback highlights critical aspects related to body positioning, joint alignment, and lift mechanics. Effective coordination across lower, middle, and upper body movements is essential to optimize performance and reduce injury risks.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Shoulder Positioning:**  
  - **Observation:** The normalised shoulder distance at setup was 1.25489, indicating shoulders are too wide relative to the hips.  
  - **Recommendation:** Adjust your stance to bring the shoulders closer to the hips (aim for 1.2 to 1.25).

- **Knee Positioning at Lift-off:**  
  - **Observation:** The normalised knee distance was 2.40863, suggesting knees are forward of the bar, risking excessive forward lean.  
  - **Recommendation:** Align your knees over or slightly behind the bar during lift-off for a more vertical torso.

- **Wrist Asymmetry:**  
  - **Observation:** The left-right wrist slope was 0.014954, indicating slight asymmetry affecting bar path.  
  - **Recommendation:** Aim for symmetrical wrist positioning to promote a straight bar path during the pull phase.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Migration:**  
  - **Observation:** Normalised knee distance was noted at 1.63612 during lift progress, indicating potential forward knee migration.  
  - **Recommendation:** Ensure knees track vertically during the lift to allow effective hip extension and balance.

- **Knee Symmetry:**  
  - **Observation:** At 80% lift progress, the right knee lateral distance from center was 0.792911, showing a deviation affecting lift symmetry.  
  - **Recommendation:** Work on equal knee placement to minimize lateral sway for a balanced lift.

- **Wrist Positioning:**  
  - **Observation:** The normalized wrist difference at 90% was high (1.7361), indicating possible arm positioning asymmetry.  
  - **Recommendation:** Focus on achieving neutral wrist positioning by adjusting arm angles to enhance stability and bar path.

- **Control During Full Extension:**  
  - **Observation:** At full extension, the normalised knee distance of 1.37149 suggests early extension, impacting action line.  
  - **Recommendation:** Maintain knee tension until full extension is achieved to control the lift and prevent momentum loss.

### Overall Recommendations
- Implement adjustments in shoulder, knee, and wrist positioning to ensure all joints align correctly throughout both the setup and pull phases.
- Emphasize the need for consistent bar path and symmetrical arm positioning to improve lift efficiency and reduce injury likelihood.
- Focus on core engagement and overall body tightness during both phases to enhance the stability needed for successful lifts.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Glute Bridges:** To strengthen hip extension and maintain knee positioning during the pull phase.
- **Single-Leg Deadlifts:** To improve balance and focus on equal knee placement and hip engagement.
- **Plank Variations:** To enhance core stability, which translates to better control and positioning throughout the deadlift.

This structured feedback report aims to provide you with actionable insights for enhancing your deadlift performance while minimizing potential injury risks. Implement these recommendations systematically for improved results."
