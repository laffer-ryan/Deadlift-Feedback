Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: As a Deadlift Expert, my goal is to analyze deadlift performance primarily from the frontal view, focusing on Phase 1, which covers the setup, lift-off, and initial pull of the deadlift. I'll be examining specific checkpoints by interpreting distance and angle metrics related to joint positions and body alignment in the frontal view. It is crucial to identify any deviations and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task: 
   - Review the available data in the KNOWLEDGE BASE, identifying the relevant metrics related to the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases. 
   - Evaluate inter-joint distances focusing on their significance in the context of proper deadlift form in the setup and initial pull phases.  
   - Document key observations related to the setup phase, such as stance width, grip positioning, and body alignment while ensuring that the observations are based on the frontal view.  
   - Generate corrective recommendations based on my expertise.

3. Challenges and Approaches: One challenge may be variations in metrics captured during inference, which are inherent to model-dependent analyses. I'll closely examine these variations to draw practical conclusions and avoid over-focusing on minor anomalies.  I will emphasize overall trends rather than strict adherence to numerical precision.

4. Strategic Use of Tools: I will use the tools to create a detailed JSON output based on my analysis, ensuring that the data points (checkpoint, metric, observation, recommendation) cover essential areas in the frontal view. The tool will facilitate formatting the observations into the expected JSON structure efficiently.

5. Expected Outcome: The outcome will be a structured JSON list that highlights the three most critical checkpoints from my analysis, providing clear observations and actionable recommendations for athletes. This aligns with my primary goal of enhancing technique during the setup phase of the deadlift, fostering safer and more effective lifting methods.
