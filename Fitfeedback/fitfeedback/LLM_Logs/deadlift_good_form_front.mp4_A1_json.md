Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: I need to analyze deadlift performance data specifically from a frontal-view perspective focusing on phase 1 of the deadlift which includes the setup, lift-off, and initial pull. My aim is to assess joint distances and their significance without focusing on the angles, and then provide detailed recommendations for improvements based on observed metrics.  

2. Key steps to complete the task: 
   - Review the provided performance data for the frontal view. 
   - Identify the relevant metrics for each checkpoint in the setup phase (frontal view). 
   - Analyze inter-joint distances and slopes to understand implications for the deadlift.  
   - Formulate observations regarding the setup, lift-off, and initial pull. 
   - Create specific recommendations to correct any identified issues.

3. Approach to challenges: I will rely on my expertise in biomechanics to interpret slight variations in captured data effectively. If the metrics show unexpected results, I will consider common deviations in the deadlift technique and recommend corrective actions accordingly.

4. Strategic use of tools: I can utilize the specified functions to create a structured format for my findings. I will summarize my evaluation in a JSON format that clearly outlines the checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations. I will focus on three key observations for clarity and relevance.

5. Expected outcome: I expect to provide a clear and actionable list of recommendations that will help improve the individualâ€™s deadlift setup based on the provided data. This aligns with my goal of optimizing the initial phases of the deadlift for safety and effectiveness.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
