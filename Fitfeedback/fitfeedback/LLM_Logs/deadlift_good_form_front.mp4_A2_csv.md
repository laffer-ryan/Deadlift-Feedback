Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: From my perspective as a Deadlift Expert, the task requires me to evaluate the deadlift performance data specifically from a frontal view during Phase 2 (mid-lift) until full extension. This involves analyzing pull mechanics and interpreting joint distances and slopes. The focus is on providing actionable recommendations the lifter can incorporate to improve their pull and extension technique.

2. **Key Steps for Completion**:
   - Review the data provided for joint distances and angles, which will highlight key movements in the mid-lift phase.
   - Analyze the relationship between the hip and knee extension and how it relates to overall lift efficiency and safety.
   - Identify deviations in form and symmetry which could impair performance or increase injury risk.
   - Formulate recommendations based on observations, focusing strictly on the pull phase (frontal view).

3. **Approaching Challenges**: Given the slight variations expected in the metrics due to YOLO model inference, I will ensure that my assessments factor in these discrepancies. I will also be mindful of focusing on actionable recommendations and will prioritize variations that indicate significant deviations from ideal form.

4. **Strategic Use of Tools**: The available function for creating a reasoning plan will help finalize the structured approach. After outlining my plan, I will leverage the multi-tool use to correlate the data evaluation with specific outputs required in the JSON format. This will ensure I capture all necessary details succinctly.

5. **Expected Outcome**: The expected outcome is a detailed yet concise JSON response that provides four defined checkpoints, each containing relevant metrics and actionable recommendations. This will align perfectly with my primary goal to enhance the deadlifting technique and further the lifter's performance in a structured manner.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
