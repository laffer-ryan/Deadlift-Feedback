Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: From a professional perspective, I recognize that the task is focused on evaluating the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases of a deadlift from the side view, enabling a detailed analysis of the joint angles and distances specific to these phases. The objective is to provide feedback and corrective recommendations based on measurable metrics related to joint movement.  

2. Key Steps: I will start by analyzing the joint angles and distances provided in the given performance data based on the left view of the deadlift. I will focus on key checkpoints corresponding to the three phases (setup, lift-off, and initial pull) and derive insights based on biomechanical principles.  Each bullet point will need to clearly articulate the checkpoint being evaluated, the relevant metric, the observed condition, and tailored recommendations for improvement.  

3. Approach to Challenges: Challenges may arise due to slight variations in the metrics captured by the YOLO model inference. I will account for these variations by focusing on only significant deviations from ideal biomechanical positions or movements and leveraging my experience to discern what constitutes a critical improvement area versus standard variability.  

4. Using Available Tools: I will use the multi_tool_use.parallel function to gather multiple outputs from the evaluation of joint angles and distances once I have identified the specific metrics for the checkpoint analysis. I anticipate running a thorough analysis that compiles three distinct actionable insights about the setup phase.  

5. Expected Outcome: The expected JSON output will detail three core findings, providing structured recommendations that align with the goal of improving the deadlift mechanics, ultimately ensuring safer and more effective lifting practices.  

After assessing my plan, I feel well-prepared to execute this task with the understanding that I have a clear structure for collecting and analyzing the performance data effectively. I will now proceed to execute the task.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques

    "recommendation": "Adjust the setup to bring the bar closer to the shins when starting the lift. Aim for a distance of approximately 5-10 cm from the shins to maintain a more biomechanically efficient position."

    "observation": "The left knee angle at the setup is 113.14 degrees, which may indicate a less effective hip hinge and excessive anterior positioning of the knees. This could hinder the use of the posterior chain.",
    "recommendation": "Encourage the lifter to push the hips back more during the setup phase, maintaining a neutral spine and a proper hip hinge to allow for a knee angle closer to 90 degrees, ensuring better engagement of the posterior chain."

  {
    "checkpoint": "Lift-off Phase",
    "metric": "posterior_chain_left",
    "observation": "The posterior chain engagement at lift-off is recorded at 90.42 degrees. This indicates insufficient tension and stability in the glutes and hamstrings, which are crucial for a successful lift.",
    "recommendation": "Instruct the lifter to focus on engaging the posterior chain through an active contraction in the glutes and hamstrings before lift-off. This can be enhanced through pre-lift drills such as glute bridges or banded walks to reinforce activation."
