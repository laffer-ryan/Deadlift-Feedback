Reasoning Plan:
### Detailed Plan for Deadlift Performance Analysis

1. **Understanding of the Task:**
   - The task involves synthesizing feedback about a lifter's deadlift performance by examining both setup and pull phases. Given my expertise, I recognize how setup errors can lead to inefficiencies during the pull phase. My role is to combine insights from two sets of feedback into a cohesive report that highlights areas needing improvement and actionable recommendations.

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Analysis:**
   - **Verify Findings:** Assess each observation and recommendation coming from the setup and pull phase feedback to ensure clarity and relevance.
   - **Combine Observations:** Identify overlapping insights or nuances in the data from both phases.
   - **Structure Report:** Organize findings into a formatted report that clearly outlines:
     - Summary of the lifter’s performance
     - Areas for improvement categorized by phase
     - Overall recommendations for enhancing technique and preventing injuries.
   - **Exercise Suggestions:** If limiting factors are identified, propose accessory exercises to strengthen those areas.

3. **Approach to Challenges:**
   - The main challenge is ensuring a clear connection between setup errors and inefficiencies in the pull phase. I will carefully read through the recommendations, looking for correlating patterns that could inform a more comprehensive understanding of the lifter’s mechanics.
   - If discrepancies are present between observations from the two sets of feedback, I will rely on my knowledge of typical performance characteristics to make justified assessments.

4. **Usage of Available Tools:**
   - I will utilize the report format structure to provide clarity to the synthesized findings in a markdown report. Each observation will be judiciously placed under its respective header (e.g., Setup Phase, Pull Phase) to facilitate a seamless presentation.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
   - The final report will clearly articulate the lifter’s deadlift performance, emphasizing specific areas for improvement. By visually presenting issues and symptoms, along with actionable recommendations, the report aims to foster an understanding of how to optimize performance and reduce injury risk.

After considering the above elements, I feel confident about executing the task effectively.

**Movement Summary:**  
The analysis of the deadlift performance highlights several key areas of concern related to both the setup and pull phases. The lifter is experiencing significant deviations in shoulder positioning, knee alignment, and wrist symmetry at various checkpoints. These issues have the potential to negatively impact lifting efficiency and increase the risk of injury. Recommendations for corrective practices are outlined below.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Shoulder Positioning**: The normalised shoulder distance of 1.455 indicates that the shoulders are positioned too far forward, which could compromise balance during the lift.   
- **Knee Alignment**: The knee distance at 1.502 indicates excessive forward travel, impacting leverage and push-off efficiency.  
- **Grip Asymmetry**: A high normalised wrist difference of 2.729 indicates an asymmetrical grip that could strain the wrists and affect balance.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Stability**: The knee distance remains above the optimal range, indicating instability at lift-off which may affect overall balance during the pull.  
- **Knee Alignment**: The left knee is moving laterally away from the midline, which can disrupt lift symmetry and efficiency.  
- **Ankle Positioning**: Notable ankle height discrepancies at the 80% lift progress stage suggest uneven load distribution, compromising effective engagement of the posterior chain.  
- **Wrist Alignment**: The noticeable lateral distance of the right wrist at full extension indicates an asymmetry that could affect the overall lift mechanics.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Proper Shoulder Positioning**: Ensure that the shoulders are directly over or slightly behind the barbell to maintain balance.
- **Knee Management**: Focus on keeping knees aligned vertically with the ankles at lift-off and during the pull to enhance leverage and ground connection.
- **Symmetric Grip**: Practice grip drills to ensure that both wrists are symmetrically positioned throughout the lift, reducing the risk of strain. 
- **Lateral Movement Control**: Incorporate exercises that promote proper alignment of the knees moving up the midline and improve overall stability.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Single-leg Deadlifts**: To improve knee stability, encourage proper alignment and balance during the lift.
- **Band-resisted Squats**: To strengthen the posterior chain while promoting proper knee alignment through resistance.
- **Wrist Mobility and Strengthening Exercises**: To address grip asymmetry and reduce the risk of wrist pain or injury.

By focusing on these areas and employing the recommended strategies, the lifter can enhance their deadlift performance, improve efficiency, and significantly reduce injury risks."
