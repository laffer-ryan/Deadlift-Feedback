Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding the Task:**  Recognizing the need to synthesize findings from both the setup and pull phases to create a comprehensive deadlift performance analysis, I will ensure the integration of insights focuses on athlete optimization, efficiency, and injury reduction. 

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Analysis:**  
   - **Phase-By-Phase Analysis:** Begin by analyzing the setup phase findings followed by the pull phase results. This structured approach will help in connecting issues effectively, such as how a setup error can lead to a pull mistake.  
   - **Identify Overlapping Issues:** Look for common threads in both phases to highlight frequent problems (e.g., foot placement, hip positioning) and their effects on overall lift performance.  
   - **Report Structuring:** Create a report divided into sections:  
     - Executive Summary: Overall insights.  
     - Detailed Analysis: Areas for improvement with specific keypoints from both phases.
     - General Recommendations: Suggestions across the lift addressing identified issues.
     - Accessory Exercise Recommendations: Targeted exercises for muscle weaknesses illuminated during the phase analyses.  
   - **Formatting Considerations:** Use bullet points and structured markdown text for clarity and ease of understanding, ensuring practicality for athletes’ training contexts.  

3. **Addressing Challenges:**  
   - **Conflict Resolution:** Synthesize potentially conflicting insights from trainers, prioritizing validated observations with robust recommendations directly tied to biomechanics. If there are contradictions in advice, I will pay closer attention to data-driven insights and adherence to fundamental lifting principles to maintain accuracy in recommendations.
 
4. **Utilizing Tools:**  
   - **Tool Selection:** Use the `functions.create_reasoning_plan` for laying out the structured logic of this approach. This will guide my internal thinking and help ensure all aspects are covered thoroughly before generating the final report. 
   - **Further Steps:** Once confident, I will execute the task through `multi_tool_use.parallel` to leverage multiple outputs (from setup and pull phase data), further streamlining synthesis and report generation. This multi-faceted approach will ensure comprehensive analysis.  

5. **Expected Outcome:**  
   - A detailed and actionable Deadlift Analysis Report that adequately addresses all performance factors, aligning with my goal of enhancing athlete performance with precise, tailored feedback and actionable recommendations. This report will influence both immediate performance adjustments and long-term strength development through accessory work suggestions.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift

**Movement Summary:**  
The analysis of the deadlift performance from the left view highlights several critical areas affecting lift efficiency and potential injury risks. Key observations from both the setup and pull phases indicate issues primarily related to positioning and synchronization of movement.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Bar Distance from Body**: The bar is too far from the body (estimated angle of ~41.96 degrees), leading to inefficiency and increased strain on the lower back.
- **Left Knee Angle**: The left knee angle is at 125.04 degrees, positioning the knees too far forward, which can compromise stability.
- **Left Hip Angle**: The left hip angle of 94.68 degrees suggests the hips are too low relative to the bar, impairing leverage for a stronger pull.

**Pull Phase**
- **Left Knee Angle**: The left knee angle during the lift-off is 113.14 degrees, indicating insufficient flexion to achieve an effective launch.
- **Transition Quality**: There is a noted delayed hip extension relative to knee extension during the initiation to mid-lift transition, suggesting a need for better synchronization for a smoother pull.
- **Wrist and Neck Alignment**: The lower left wrist angle of 105.73 degrees indicates grip strength may be compromised, while a neck angle reduction to 138.99 degrees may signify misalignment, risking strain.

### Overall Recommendations
- Position the bar closer to the shins during setup to improve lift mechanics and back safety.
- Adjust the left knee position to maintain a more vertical shin angle, ensuring better hip elevation.
- Enhance synchronization between knee and hip extension during the lift to create a more powerful and fluid motion.
- Maintain a neutral wrist position to improve grip control and mitigate risk of injury.
- Keep the head aligned neutrally with the spine to prevent neck strain throughout the lift.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Hip Hinge Drills**: To reinforce proper hip positioning and movement mechanics.
- **Kettlebell Deadlifts**: To build strength in the lower back and improve grip strength while focusing on bar path and positioning.
- **Wall Squats**: To refine knee mechanics and develop strength in vertical shin positioning.
- **Shoulder Mobility Exercises**: To enhance effective upper body positioning and alleviate wrist strain.

By addressing these key findings and implementing the recommendations, the efficacy of the deadlift performance will likely improve, reducing the risk of injury and maximizing strength gains."
