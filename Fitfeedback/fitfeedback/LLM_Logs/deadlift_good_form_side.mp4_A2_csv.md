Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding the Task:** I recognize that the objective is to analyze deadlift performance data captured from a side-view camera, focusing specifically on Phase 2 (mid-lift) mechanics. This involves evaluating joint angles and metrics at various checkpoints during the pull phase until full extension. I will not take into account frontal plane asymmetries or joint distances since they are not observable from this perspective. 

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:** My first step will be to examine the joint angles from the provided data, including the hip and knee angles, as these will reveal how well the lifter is executing the pull phase. I will assess the angles to check for symmetry and alignment in knee and hip extensions.
I will identify 4 key checkpoints (e.g., start of mid-lift, peak knee flexion, peak hip extension, and full lockout). For each checkpoint, I will note any deviations from ideal angles and provide corrective recommendations tailored to improve their pull, knee, and hip extensions.

3. **Approach to Challenges:** Given the variability that may arise from data captured by the YOLO model, I will carefully analyze slight deviations in the metrics. If discrepancies are observed, I will cross-check them against established standards for optimal deadlifting form to provide the most accurate observations. 

4. **Strategically Using the Tools:** I will use the provided evaluation data and my expertise in biomechanics to create a detailed JSON list of findings. Each entry will include a checkpoint, metric, observation, and recommendation. I will focus strictly on joint angles since other metrics aren't available, ensuring each bullet point is concise and aimed at improving the lift based on my analysis.

5. **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a detailed JSON list summarizing the key findings and recommendations for improving the pull phase of the deadlift, aligned with my goal of providing expert feedback and corrections for the lifter's technique.
