Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the task: As a deadlift expert, my task is to evaluate the pull phase of the deadlift from a frontal view. I must analyze joint metrics such as distances and slopes, and provide insights on the technique, while making recommendations for improvement based on my expertise. 

2. Key steps to complete the task: 
   a. Conduct a thorough analysis of the provided joint distance metrics and their interplay during the mid-lift phase of the deadlift. 
   b. Identify any abnormalities or inefficiencies in the pull phase based on my understanding of biomechanics. 
   c. Develop specific recommendations tailored to common issues observed, focusing on knee and hip extension and alignment. 
   d. Summarize key findings and present them in a structured JSON format containing the checkpoint, metric, observation, and recommendation for each of the findings. 

3. Challenges and approach: 
   - Handling slight variations in metrics is a challenge as data is captured from a YOLO model inference. I will apply my experience to interpret these variations and ensure recommendations are practical and applicable regardless of minor deviations. 
   - Ensuring that my analysis effectively addresses major issues of form and technique during the pull phase will demand close attention to detail and understanding of joint mechanics.

4. Strategic use of tools: 
   - I will utilize available functions to format and structure my findings into the required JSON format. The tools will help me organize checkpoints and observations clearly to align my recommendations with findings. 
   - I will document each finding with precision, ensuring that each recommendation corresponds to specific observations from the metrics provided.

5. Expected outcome: The outcome will be a concise evaluation format consisting of 4 bullet points that can effectively guide practitioners in refining their deadlift performance around the mid-lift phase and will provide actionable steps to enhance their technique, aligning with my expertise in this area.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
