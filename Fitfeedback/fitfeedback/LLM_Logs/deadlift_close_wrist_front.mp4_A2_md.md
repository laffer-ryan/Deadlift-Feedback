Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: The objective is to analyze the deadlift performance data utilizing a front view perspective, particularly focusing on Phase 2 (mid-lift to full extension) mechanics. My extensive background in biomechanics will allow me to evaluate critical metrics related to joint distances and slopes, even if joint angles are not available in this perspective. The ultimate aim is to pinpoint deviations in technique, highlight critical checkpoints, and provide targeted recommendations for improving the pull phase of the deadlift.

2. Key steps: First, I will analyze the provided data to identify key metrics concerning symmetry in hip and knee extension. Iâ€™ll focus on measuring the inter-joint distances and slopes related to the alignment of the hips and knees throughout the lift. Then, I'll summarize observations based on these metrics, noting any deviations in form or technique. Finally, I will formulate recommendations that correspond to each checkpoint identified, providing actionable insights for improved performance.

3. Challenges: Potential challenges include slight variations in metrics due to limitations from the YOLO model inference. As a coach, I will need to be flexible and considerate of these variations while maintaining a focus on major issues rather than getting lost in minutiae that do not significantly impact performance. Enhancing communication with the athlete about their form will also be essential.

4. Strategy for tools: I plan to use the multi_tool_use.parallel action to conduct simultaneous analyses of multiple checkpoints based on hip and knee extension metrics. I will prepare four distinct bullet points that cover all required details: checkpoint, metric, observation, and recommendation for the pull phase, leveraging my knowledge in biomechanics for accurate evaluations.

5. Expected outcomes: I anticipate drafting a well-structured JSON response that encapsulates four major insights, which will provide a beneficial summary of findings along with actionable recommendations that align with the athlete's goals of enhancing their deadlift performance.

I am confident that this plan covers all necessary components to complete the task effectively and comprehensively.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
