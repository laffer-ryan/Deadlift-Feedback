Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: The task is to analyze the deadlift performance data from a frontal view focusing on Phase 1 (setup, lift-off, and initial pull). The provided data includes distance and angle measurements for specific joints, which I will evaluate to identify issues related to the setup and initiation of the lift. I will focus particularly on stance, grip, and body alignment while interpreting the metrics provided in the Knowledge Base.

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:  
   - Review the frontal view data based on the given metrics, specifically distance measurements and slopes, as they pertain to joint positions during setup and lift-off.  
   - Identify three critical checkpoints in this phase: initial stance, grip setup, and spine alignment at liftoff.
   - For each checkpoint, identify relevant metrics (like stance width and alignment of the barbell over the mid-foot), make observations regarding their current state, and formulate specific recommendations for improvement.  

3. Approach to Challenges:  
   - I may encounter slight variations in data due to the nature of capturing metrics from a frontal view. I will maintain flexibility in my evaluation to account for minor deviations while focusing on significant faults. 
   - If the metrics are ambiguous, I will leverage my understanding of biomechanics to draw reasonable conclusions based on common deadlifting errors. 

4. Strategy for Using Tools:  
   - I will use the multi_tool_use.parallel function to analyze the data and compile my findings into the expected JSON format, ensuring all required fields are included for clarity and actionable feedback. 

5. Expected Outcome:  
   - My analysis will culminate in a structured output containing three key findings, each detailing a specific checkpoint, its corresponding metric, observations about the current execution of the deadlift, and tailored recommendations. This aligns with my goal of providing holistic feedback to improve the practitioner's deadlift performance.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
