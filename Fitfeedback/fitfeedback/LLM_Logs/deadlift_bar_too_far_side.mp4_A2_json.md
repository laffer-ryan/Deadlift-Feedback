Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: As a Deadlift Expert with a focus on phase 2 (mid-lift) mechanics, I will analyze the provided joint angles and distances relevant to the deadlift performance on the left view. The task requires me to evaluate and interpret these metrics, focusing solely on the pull phase of the lift until full extension while ignoring frontal plane issues and joint distances due to the use of side view data. 

2. Key Steps: I will begin by closely examining the joint angles at critical checkpoints during the mid-lift phase. These checkpoints typically include the position of the hips, knees, and overall alignment of the body. I will look for optimal angles that correlate with effective biomechanics, indicating proper joint extension and alignment. 

3. Approach to Challenges: I expect variations in the metrics due to the YOLO model inference capturing the data. I will address this by considering slight deviations as normal, focusing on the overall patterns and trends rather than absolute values. Additionally, I will analyze whether anatomical differences in the lifter could be influencing the data. 

4. Tools Utilization: I will input the gathered metrics into a structured format for evaluation, deriving four key bullet points that summarize critical observations and recommendations. This can be achieved using the multi_tool_use.parallel function to create the outputs from the side view analysis effectively. I will ensure that I am using the metrics provided in the KNOWLEDGE BASE and any relevant definitions to support my analysis. 

5. Expected Outcomes: The expected output is a JSON list containing four checkpoints related to the mid-lift phase of the deadlift. Each bullet point will detail the checkpoint, associated metric, observations from the analysis, and targeted recommendations for improvement. This aligns with my goal to diagnose and rectify lifting technique, ensuring that the lifter achieves optimal performance while minimizing injury risk.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques

    "metric": "left_hip_angle",
    "observation": "The left hip angle is about 96.38 degrees, which suggests that the hips are not fully extending, potentially leading to an inefficient pull.",
    "recommendation": "Concentrate on driving the hips forward through the lift to achieve a hip angle closer to 180 degrees as you reach full extension."
