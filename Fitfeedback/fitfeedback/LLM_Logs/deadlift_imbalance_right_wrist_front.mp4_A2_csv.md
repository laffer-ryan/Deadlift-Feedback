Reasoning Plan:
1. From a professional perspective, I understand that the task requires analyzing deadlift performance data for the front view, specifically focusing on Phase 2 (mid-lift) mechanics. I need to evaluate the pull phase until full extension without relying on joint angles, as those metrics are unavailable in the frontal view. The goal is to provide strategic recommendations based on the inter-joint distances, slopes, and observed deviations in form and technique.

2. Key steps to complete the evaluation include: 
   - Reviewing the provided joint distance metrics and their respective slopes from the front view.
   - Interpreting how these distances and slopes relate to effective deadlift mechanics, particularly focusing on hip and knee extension alignment.
   - Identifying the key checkpoints for the pull phase, which may include areas like bar path trajectory, shoulder position, and hip engagement during the lift.
   - Formulating observations based on the analyzed data without joint angles but focusing on the distances and angles created by the entire lift.
   - Developing specific recommendations to address any issues in symmetry or alignment based on expert knowledge of biomechanics.

3. Challenges may include variations in the metrics captured by the YOLO model, which can yield slight deviations in observations. I will remain attentive to these variations and differentiate between minor fluctuations that can be corrected with general feedback and more significant deviations that may need specific instructions to correct.

4. The main tool available is the one to create structured outputs in JSON format, which I will use to outline the four key checkpoints as per the evaluation. I will ensure each checkpoint provides a comprehensive view by summarizing the metric observed, the specific observation made, and a concrete recommendation for correction.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
