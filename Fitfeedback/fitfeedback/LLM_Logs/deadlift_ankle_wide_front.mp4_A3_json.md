Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: The goal is to analyze the deadlift performance data for both the setup and pull phases by verifying findings from two agents (the setup and pull phase analyses). I'll synthesize key findings, focusing on the most impactful aspects of each phase to create a comprehensive report. This will help identify technical flaws and provide guidance for performance improvements.  

2. **Steps to Complete the Task**:  
   - Review the findings from the deadlift_setup_trainer and deadlift_pull_trainer to identify overlapping issues and specific feedback.  
   - Filter the most impactful points for inclusion in the final report.  
   - Organize the report into sections: Movement Summary, Areas for Improvement (divided into setup, pull, and overall), and specific recommendations to enhance technique and prevent injuries.  
   - If necessary, suggest accessory exercises as additional resources for addressing limiting factors.  

3. **Addressing Challenges**: Ensuring a clear and concise synthesis of findings while maintaining a focus on actionable insights can be complex. I will stay focused on the most relevant aspects from both phases and avoid redundancy. Misalignment in metrics across phases can be a point of confusion; thus, I will cross-verify data to ensure consistency in assessments.  

4. **Use of Available Tools**: The multitool function will allow me to effectively manage data from both setups. I'll use it to create the reasoning plan for the report synthesis, ensuring all insights and recommendations are included in the final output effectively.  

5. **Expected Outcome**: The final report will be a structured and coherent analysis of the deadlift performance, with clear areas for improvement, actionable recommendations, and possibly accessory exercise suggestions if any limiting factors are identified. This will align with my goal of providing insightful coaching tailored for both technique improvement and injury prevention.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift

**Movement Summary:**  
The analysis of your deadlift performance reveals several critical areas where improvements can significantly enhance both your technique and efficiency. The findings indicate challenges in setup positioning and pull mechanics that may lead to potential imbalances and non-optimal execution, increasing the risk of injury.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Stance Width**: The normalised ankle difference indicates your stance is outside the ideal range, affecting balance. Adjust your stance to align your ankles under your hips.
- **Grip Symmetry**: The lateral distance from the center for both wrists shows inconsistency. Ensure your grip width is uniform to promote a symmetrical pull trajectory.
- **Bar Proximity at Liftoff**: The bar's distance from the body is too large at liftoff, increasing stress on the lower back. Bringing the bar closer will improve mechanics and reduce spinal loading.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Stability**: There’s a notable decrease in normalised knee distance, suggesting inward knee collapse. Focus on actively pushing out your knees laterally throughout the lift.
- **Ankle Balance**: While the ankle difference is consistent, it trends towards imbalance. Ensure equal weight distribution and foot placement to maintain symmetry.
- **Knee Alignment**: The right knee's lateral distance from center shows a decrease, indicating possible inward movement. Maintain lateral tension to prevent collapsing and ensure proper tracking.
- **Shoulder Symmetry**: Varying shoulder heights at full extension suggest a need for even shoulder positioning throughout the lift. Engage your upper back to prevent tilt. 

**Overall Recommendations**
- **Enhance Focus on Form**: Pay attention to maintaining an even setup, specifically concerning grip and stance width, during all phases of the lift.
- **Monitor Body Alignment**: Continuously check the positions of your knees and shoulders to ensure proper alignment, both to enhance lifting efficiency and prevent injuries.
- **Practice Consistency**: Aim for uniformity in grip, stance, and body alignment at every stage of the lift to foster biomechanical efficiency.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Cossack Squats**: To improve lateral stability and strengthen adductors which will assist in maintaining knee positioning during the pull phase.
- **Single-Leg Deadlifts**: Enhance balance and coordinate muscle engagement across the left and right sides, promoting symmetry and stability.
- **Barbell Hip Thrusts**: Strengthen the glutes and hip extensors, which directly support the deadlift mechanics, especially during the pull phase. 

By implementing these recommendations and focusing on the outlined areas for improvement, you can enhance your deadlift performance while minimizing injury risks."
