Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: I need to evaluate the deadlift performance data collected from a side view during the mid-lift phase to assess the pull techniques including knee and hip extension until the lift reaches full extension. This will involve analyzing joint angles and any deviations from optimal biomechanics, with a focus on recommendations for improved performance.

2. Key steps to complete the evaluation:
   - Review the provided joint angles metrics relative to ideal deadlift mechanics.
   - Analyze hip and knee joint angles during the middle of the lift up to full extension.
   - Identify discrepancies or inefficiencies in the lift's mechanics.
   - Summarize findings into four specific checkpoints that include recommendations for corrections.

3. Approach to challenges: I will leverage my expertise in biomechanics to interpret the joint angles effectively. If there are significant deviations detected, I will ensure to provide actionable feedback tailored to the athlete's individual needs. Understanding slight variations is critical based on the data source (YOLO model inference) and will be flagged if they are within acceptable ranges.

4. Use of available tools: I will use analytical skills to interpret the joint angles and construct a JSON format of the findings. The tool used will be the JSON output, which will summarize the evaluation into bullet points, ensuring clarity and conciseness.
   - Extract metrics for four checkpoints focusing on hip and knee angles and overall lift technique.

5. Expected outcome: I will provide a detailed JSON list with observations and actionable recommendations for each checkpoint, enabling practitioners to enhance their deadlift performance effectively. This aligns with my goal of promoting safe and effective lifting techniques.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
