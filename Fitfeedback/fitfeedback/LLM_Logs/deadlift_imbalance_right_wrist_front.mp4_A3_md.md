Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding the Task:**
   - As an experienced physical trainer, I will synthesize insights from the setup and pull phase data related to a deadlifter's performance. Focusing on coordination across body segments, I'll merge feedback from both phases to form a coherent picture of the lifter's form and technique, ensuring each element aligns with safe and effective lifting practices.

2. **Key Steps for Completion:**
   - **Data Verification and Synthesis:**
     - Begin by reviewing the setup and pull stage findings: shoulder and knee positioning at lift-off and throughout the progression.
     - Identify the metrics indicating asymmetry or imbalance such as shoulder slopes and knee tracking.
     - Cross-check both phases to see how initial setup influences the pull and any subsequent issues.
   - **Analysis and Structuring:**
     - Group observations related to setup and pull phases separately while correlating them.
     - Highlight key improvement areas and compile insightful, actionable feedback.
   - **Recommendation Drafting:**
     - Develop recommendations for each key finding focusing on biomechanics, injury prevention, and lifting efficacy.
     - Consider accessory exercises that address the root cause of identified issues where relevant.

3. **Approach to Challenges:**
   - **Data Interpretation Overlaps:** Given my expertise, I will adeptly align setup errors with downstream pull issues, ensuring clarity.
   - **Conflicting Recommendations:** Where applicable, I’ll refocus on fundamentals of biomechanics to resolve contradictions.

4. **Strategic Tool Use:**
   - Use the data outputs to draft a markdown report that provides insight and is suitable for rendering within Streamlit. This will guarantee a clear and accessible presentation of the analysis.
   - Create distinct sections for executive summary, improvement across phases, recommendations, and accessory exercises if needed.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
   - Generate a comprehensive, structured markdown report that is professional, actionable, and client-ready. It should clearly convey feedback regarding form, safety, and efficiency in the deadlift technique aligning with injury prevention strategies and performance improvements.

Based on the plan, the task should be executable efficiently and effectively, meeting both my professional standards and client expectations for improvement guidance.

**Movement Summary:**  
The deadlift performance exhibits areas of both balance and asymmetry, particularly in shoulder and knee positioning during the lift-off and pull phases. Established alignment issues can affect stability and power, warranting targeted corrections to optimize biomechanics and enhance lift efficiency.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Shoulder Position:** At lift-off, the shoulder distance is slightly off-balance (1.48611), though relatively decent, can be improved by ensuring the shoulders are slightly in front of the bar.
- **Knee Engagement:** The knee distance at lift-off (1.21374) indicates insufficient leg engagement. Adjust the shin angle and align knees over toes to enhance leg drive.
- **Symmetry in Leg Press:** The right knee's lateral distance (0.774132) is greater, suggesting more weight distribution on one leg. Promote even bilateral leg drive.

**Pull Phase**
- **Shoulder Height:** Minimal left shoulder elevation detected (slope 0.0370791). Focus on leveling shoulders throughout the pull.
- **Knee Tracking Symmetry:** At 60% progression, the knee distance is consistent but reveals asymmetry in lateral positioning. Maintain parallel knee tracking.
- **Ankle Positioning:** Slight rightward bias detected in the ankle during the pull (distance 0.691344). Equalize foot stance and weight distribution for stable force application.

**Overall Recommendations**
- Adjust shoulder positioning slightly forward at the setup to utilize upper body strength effectively in the initial pull.
- Work on even weight distribution to alleviate unequal muscle activation, focusing on both feet and maintaining parallel alignment throughout the lift.
- Monitor shoulder and knee symmetry throughout the movement to prevent potential imbalances that can impair lift progression and increase injury risk.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Shoulder Alignment:** Incorporate face pulls and band pull-aparts to strengthen shoulder stabilizers and improve shoulder alignment.
- **Leg Engagement:** Add single-leg Romanian deadlifts and lunges to address asymmetry and improve leg drive dynamics.
- **Core Stability:** Performing planks and Russian twists can enhance core stability, which is critical in maintaining a solid and balanced position throughout the deadlift.

This report synthesizes multiple setup and pull phase insights to provide targeted strategies for refining your deadlift technique, encouraging balanced muscle engagement, and supporting power development while minimizing injury risk."
