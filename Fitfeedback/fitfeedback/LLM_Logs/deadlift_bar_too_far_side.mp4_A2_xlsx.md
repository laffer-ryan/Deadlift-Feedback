Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: I understand that the task involves analyzing deadlift performance data, specifically focused on the phase 2 (mid-lift) mechanics from a left-side view. I will evaluate joint angles and metrics pertinent to hip and knee extension, and the overall performance in the lift's pull phase until full extension.

2. Key Steps for Completion:
   a. Review and analyze the joint angles provided in the KNOWLEDGE BASE.
   b. Identify important metrics related to hip and knee extension during the mid-lift phase and evaluate their significance.
   c. Summarize findings related to the pull phase, recording any deviations or issues found in the performance.
   d. Develop actionable recommendations to improve technique at every checkpoint.

3. Addressing Challenges: I anticipate challenges in determining the exact implications of slight joint angle deviations. I will leverage my extensive background in biomechanics to interpret these deviations appropriately and refine advice accordingly.

4. Tools Utilization: I will utilize the available tool to structure my output in the required JSON format after performing the detailed evaluation. I will process the metrics for extraction of key observations and recommendations.

5. Expected Outcome: I expect to provide a comprehensive set of recommendations that target joint performance during the deadlift mid-lift phase, contributing to improved technique and efficiency. This aligns with my goal to identify and rectify major issues with form and technique, ensuring a successful execution of the deadlift.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques

        "checkpoint": "Lift-off",
        "metric": "left_knee_angle",
        "observation": "The left knee angle is at 125.04 degrees, which indicates an almost fully extended knee. This can potentially lead to imbalance during the lift.",
        "recommendation": "Focus on keeping a more engaged knee position by ensuring itâ€™s slightly more flexed at the start. Aim for approximately 110-120 degrees of knee flexion to enhance stability and power transfer during the pull."

        "observation": "The left hip angle is recorded at 112.39 degrees, suggesting that the hip is not fully extended, impacting the power output of the lift.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure that the hip extension occurs earlier in the pull by increasing tension in the posterior chain. Attempt to reach an angle closer to 90 degrees at this stage for optimal force production."

        "observation": "The bar distance from the body has increased to 32.43 cm, which can compromise leverage and stability.",
        "recommendation": "Maintain a closer bar path throughout the lift. Work on bracing your core effectively to keep the barbell near your body, ideally keeping it within 18-24 cm from the shins throughout the lift."

        "recommendation": "Keep the neck neutral throughout the lift. Focus on looking forward instead of upward to maintain alignment of your spine, which enhances overall mechanical efficiency."
