Reasoning Plan:
1. **Gather Deadlift Performance Data**: Start by collecting specific performance data focused on keypoints such as joint angles, bar path, body alignment, and any other relevant metrics available in the visual analysis of the lifter's deadlift from the front view. This baseline will guide the entire analysis. 

2. **Analyze Setup Phase**: Utilize the findings from the deadlift_setup_trainer to pinpoint setup-related issues like grip width, foot positioning, hip alignment, and overall spinal integrity. This groundwork is essential to link the initial setup with the subsequent pull phase. 

3. **Analyze Pull Phase**: Review the data from the deadlift_pull_trainer, observing the pull’s mechanics such as bar path consistency, hip dynamics, knee movement, and shoulder positioning throughout the lift. These details will help to unveil how setup flaws compromise pulling technique. 

4. **Verification of Insights**: Cross-examine findings from the setup and pull analyses with the collected raw performance metrics to ensure all identified issues are accurately supported by the data. This verification step is crucial to substantiate claims and recommendations. 

5. **Integrate Insights from Both Phases**: Merge insights from the setup and pull phases to create a comprehensive view of the lifter’s biomechanics, focusing on the interplay of movements between the lower body, mid body, and upper body, and how they collectively affect performance. 

6. **Recommendations for Improvement**: Develop concrete corrective strategies specifically addressing the pinpointed issues. Recommend targeted exercises that enhance strength and stability in the identified limiting areas, aiding the lifter in progressing both form and efficiency while minimizing injury risk. Exercises could include Romanian deadlifts, hip thrusts, and core stability drills. 

7. **Compile a Comprehensive Feedback Report**: Synthesize all analyses, insights, and recommendations into a clear and actionable performance feedback report. This report will cover the entire lift, providing the lifter a roadmap for improvement moving forward. 

**Tool Usage Strategy**: 
- For the data-gathering phase, I will analyze existing video data of the lifter, ensuring we capture real-time feedback on performance. 
- The insights from the setup and pull analyses will guide our understanding of specific issues, ensuring the report articulately connects these phases. 
- Verification against performance metrics serves to emphasize the credibility of the analysis and boosts confidence in the recommendations.

Based on this detailed and refined plan to integrate insights and provide thorough analysis, I assess that I am now ready to execute the task effectively.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift
", status="completed", output="## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
The deadlift performance indicates several areas of inefficiency stemming from setup errors that extend into the pulling phase. Specifically, issues with knee positioning, ankle distance, and wrist symmetry were prevalent throughout the lift, adversely affecting overall stability and strength exertion. Addressing these issues will improve lift efficiency, reduce the risk of injury, and enhance overall performance.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Knee Distance:** During the lift-off and at 60% progression, there is a significant increase in normalised knee distance (2.40863 and 1.7398, respectively). This suggests a potential for anterior knee shift and inefficient positioning that could hinder initial pulling mechanics.
- **Ankle Alignment:** At mid-lift progress (50%), a wide gap in ankle distance (1.81698) indicates uneven loading and instability before the initial lift.
- **Hip Positioning:** The high knee distance readings also imply that lowering the hips more during setup could aid in maintaining a proper bar path.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Extension:** At all checkpoints (70%, 80%, 90%), knee distance remains relatively high (1.636, 1.5797, 1.50796), suggesting excessive knee extension early in the lift; this misalignment could lead to forward leaning.
- **Wrist Symmetry:** A significant absence of symmetry among wrist positions was identified, particularly at 80% (1.706) and progressing to 90% (1.736), which may result in uneven force distribution.
- **Knee Tracking:** The right knee lateral distance (0.753) indicates an inward tracking during the lift, which could disrupt balance and bar path.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Avoid Forward Knee Shift:** Aim to maintain a vertical shin angle by pushing through the heels during setup. This will support proper knee alignment and encourage posterior chain engagement.
- **Enhance Grip Symmetry:** Include exercises focused on wrist alignment and grip symmetry to support overall upper body stability during the lift.
- **Improve Ankle Mobility and Alignment:** Regularly incorporate ankle mobility drills to ensure that you are driving through the heels rather than the toes during concentric extension.
- **Focus on Knee Control:** Emphasize techniques to push the knees outward as you lift to ensure they stay aligned with the bar's path.
  
### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Romanian Deadlifts:** To strengthen the posterior chain and improve hip hinging mechanics.
- **Hip Thrusts:** To enhance glute activation and overall hip strength.
- **Core Stability Drills:** Such as planks or dead bugs to improve midline stability throughout the lift.
- **Lateral Band Walks:** To strengthen abductors and improve knee tracking stability.

By focusing on these areas, you'll be able to significantly enhance your deadlift performance, ensuring both safety and efficacy in your training."
