Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: I need to evaluate the form and technique of a deadlift as viewed from the side, focusing on phase 1 metrics like the setup, lift-off, and initial pull. I will analyze joint angles and distances for specific joints based on the provided deadlift performance data and provide targeted recommendations for improvements in the setup phase.

2. Key Steps: 
   - Familiarize myself with the definitions of the provided metrics in the knowledge base to ensure accurate interpretations.
   - Analyze the data concerning the specified joint angles and their significance regarding the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases of the deadlift.
   - Summarize the findings into 3 key bullet points, focusing on critical aspects such as angle deviations, alignment issues, and their impact on performance and safety.

3. Challenges: Potential differences in metrics captured by the YOLO model could lead to slight variations in interpretations. I will account for these variations by focusing on overall patterns and learning points rather than pinpointing minor discrepancies.

4. Tool Usage: I will utilize the `functions.create_reasoning_plan` to formally outline my thought process and reasoning in taking on this evaluation task. Based on the outcome of this reasoning plan, I may use `functions.parallel` to implement my evaluation and provide recommendations in JSON format.

5. Expected Outcome: The detailed analysis will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the lifter's setup phase, offering corrective insights that enhance performance and safety. The recommendations will align with my goal to ensure lifters initiate the deadlift effectively and efficiently, adhering to biomechanical principles.

Overall, the clarity of the plan and understanding of the task give me confidence in my readiness. I look forward to executing it effectively and offering valuable insights.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques

        "recommendation": "To improve the lift-off, the lifter should aim to set their hips higher in the setup position, creating a more optimal hip angle (around 70 degrees). This allows for better recruitment of the posterior chain and helps maintain a strong back angle."

        "recommendation": "The lifter should focus on keeping the barbell closer to their shins at the start, ideally within 5-10 cm. This helps maintain leverage and decreases the likelihood of compromising form as they lift."

        "recommendation": "Encourage the lifter to maintain a slight bend in the knees rather than locking them out. A knee angle around 160-170 degrees at this point can help facilitate a stronger pull by utilizing the leg drive more effectively."
