Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: I understand that the task involves evaluating a deadlift performance based on data provided, specifically focusing on joint metrics from a side-view perspective during the pull phase of the lift. The goal is to identify potential issues in the technique and provide tailored recommendations to improve performance, particularly concerning the interplay of hips and knees during extension.

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**:  
   - Analyze the joint distances and slopes provided in the data in relation to the mid-lift position.  
   - Identify important checkpoints that are critical for proper form during the pull phase.  
   - Note observations regarding the current technique and provide corrective recommendations to enhance lift performance.  
   - Structure findings into a JSON format with specified fields: checkpoint, metric, observation, and recommendation.

3. **Approach to Challenges**:  
   - Any deviations or anomalies in the joint metrics will be approached by closely examining the biomechanics of the deadlift to ensure that corrections align with safe and effective lifting strategies.  
   - I will prioritize maintaining symmetry and the proper sequence of hip and knee extension. If necessary data points are missing, I will utilize my understanding of biomechanics to infer the best practices. 

4. **Using Available Tools**:  
   - I will use the create_reasoning_plan functions to refine the understanding and task details if necessary. However, for analyzing joint data, I may need to rely on multi-tool use later if further breakdown is needed for detailed recommendations.

5. **Expected Outcome**:  
   - The outcome will refine understanding of critical points in the lift and provide actionable feedback to an athlete, presented clearly in a JSON format. This aligns with my goal of delivering expert analysis and recommendations for improving deadlift performance.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
