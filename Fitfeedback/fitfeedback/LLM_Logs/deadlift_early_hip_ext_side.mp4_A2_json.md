Reasoning Plan:
1. From my professional perspective as a Deadlift Expert, the task requires a thorough evaluation of the deadlift's pull phase focusing on mid-lift to full extension mechanics using measurements provided. Understanding the biomechanics of knee and hip extension during this phase is crucial. 

2. The key steps I'll take include: 
   - Analyze the joint angles and their significance in the deadlift movement. 
   - Identify any deviations from ideal form based on the provided side-view data, paying close attention to the alignment and symmetry of hip and knee extension. 
   - Formulate specific recommendations addressing any identified issues to optimize performance. 

3. Challenges may arise from nuances in the captured data, but my expertise allows me to interpret variations. I'll focus on minor adjustments that could lead to significant improvements and ensure that my recommendations are practical and actionable. 

4. I will use the available tools to structure my findings and recommendations. I will create a JSON list with four detailed bullet points that summarize the observations and corrections related to the pull phase. Each point will be structured with 'checkpoint', 'metric', 'observation', and 'recommendation' fields. 

5. The expected outcome is a detailed and structured analysis that highlights key performance checkpoints in the deadlift, ensuring that the athlete can understand and correct their technique effectively. This aligns with my goal of providing precise feedback to enhance their deadlift performance.
