Reasoning Plan:
## Detailed Reasoning Plan

1. **Understanding of the Task:**
   As a Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach, the goal is to analyze the left view deadlift performance data while integrating findings from both the setup and pull phases. This involves identifying any setup or pull issues that could impact overall performance and safety. The insights will be synthesized into a comprehensive report that includes actionable recommendations for improving lifting technique.

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**
   - **Data Verification:** First, confirm the findings from the deadlift_setup_trainer and deadlift_pull_trainer regarding the specified metrics. 
   - **Integration of Insights:** Combine the key observations and recommendations from both phases to identify overarching issues related to technique and performance.
   - **Structured Report Creation:** Organize the findings into a clear markdown format that highlights areas for improvement, actionable recommendations, and optional accessory exercises.

3. **Approaching Challenges:**
   It may be challenging to ensure that the recommendations are clear and actionable, especially when addressing complex mechanics in the deadlift. To mitigate this, a thorough breakdown of each phase will be performed so the insights are easily relatable to each specific component of the lift.

4. **Use of Available Tools:**
   I will use the `functions.create_reasoning_plan` to formalize the plan and ensure it aligns with the task requirements. After verifying the findings through data analysis, I will compile the results into a markdown report format for clarity and usability in a Streamlit application.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
   The final report will serve as a comprehensive guide for the athlete to improve their deadlift performance efficiently. It will help them understand the critical areas needing attention, provide strategic corrections, and suggest supplementary exercises to address any weak points.

**Conclusion:** 
After assessing the plan, I feel that I've articulated a clear and comprehensive approach to execute the task effectively.

", status="completed", output="## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
The overall deadlift performance analysis reveals a few critical areas for adjustment in the setup phase as well as in the pull phase, particularly concerning body positioning and joint alignment. The feedback highlights discrepancies that can limit power transfer and lead to potential imbalances, affecting performance and increasing injury risk. 

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Bar Distance from Body**: The bar is positioned 11.2797 units away from the body, which can reduce leverage. 
- **Hip Angle**: The left hip angle at 56.3758 degrees indicates hips are relatively high, which may hinder pull initiation. 
- **Knee Position**: A left knee angle of 107.196 degrees suggests knees are too far back, impacting lift efficiency. 

**Pull Phase**
- **Shoulder Slope**: A slight rightward shoulder slope indicates potential muscle imbalances.
- **Knee Asymmetry**: The normalized knee distance shows a difference in forward progression between knees.
- **Head Tilt**: A negative head tilt slope at 90% lift suggests forward head position could compromise spinal alignment.
- **Wrist Alignment**: The normalized wrist difference indicates a potential issue with the left wrist position during the lift.

### Overall Recommendations
- Position the bar closer to the shins at lift-off. This will enhance leverage and improve power transfer throughout the lift.
- Lower the starting hip position slightly to optimize knee engagement and enhance power generation.
- Ensure knees are positioned over the toes during the setup phase for optimal leverage and balance.
- Actively engage both shoulders to maintain symmetry; adjust the grip to keep the bar close to the body during the ascent.
- Focus on pushing both knees outwards evenly during the pull to minimize lateral movement and ensure balance.
- Maintain a neutral head position aligned with the spine; fixate your gaze slightly ahead, which will help maintain an upright torso and facilitate power transfer.
- Ensure both wrists are aligned and applying equal pressure on the bar to promote stability.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Glute Bridges**: Strengthen hip extension and improve overall posterior chain activation.
- **Kneeling Landmine Press**: Enhance core stability and shoulder engagement during lifts.
- **Band Pull Aparts**: Promote shoulder mobility and strength to alleviate imbalances.

By implementing these recommendations, the lifter can improve their deadlift efficiency, enhance power output, and significantly reduce the risk of injury while also facilitating a more balanced and effective lifting technique."
