Reasoning Plan:
## Detailed Reasoning Plan

1. **Understanding of the Task:**
   - My goal is to analyze deadlift performance using feedback from the setup and pull phases. I will synthesize findings into a structured report, highlighting areas for improvement and providing specific recommendations for technique enhancement and injury prevention.

2. **Key Steps for Completion:**
   - I will review the feedback from the setup and pull phases, focusing on critical observations for significant impacts on the performance.
   - I will categorize findings into distinct areas: setup phase, pull phase, and overall recommendations.
   - Each point will include actionable insights for improvement as well as practical recommendations for injury prevention.
   - If any limiting factors are identified, I will suggest appropriate accessory exercises to support skill enhancement.

3. **Approach to Challenges:**
   - I plan to carefully validate and prioritize findings based on their significance to overall performance and safety. This prioritization will ensure that my recommendations will effectively address the most critical issues faced by clients.

4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools:**
   - I will utilize the `multi_tool_use.parallel` function as all the necessary tools have been provided in the prompt.
   - No additional tools are needed beyond those for aggregating the setup and pull data into a cohesive final report.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
   - The final report will clearly present an executive summary of the deadlift performance, highlight problematic areas, and provide clear, actionable recommendations tailored to improve form, efficiency, and reduce injury risk.
   - This aligns with my overarching goal of providing comprehensive analyses that enhance athletic performance.

**Conclusion:**

", status="completed", output="## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
The deadlift analysis reveals multiple areas needing improvement regarding knee alignment, wrist positioning, and overall symmetry across the setup and pull phases. There are notable discrepancies that, if corrected, can enhance both performance and reduce injury risks.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Knee Alignment:** 
  - **Issue:** The normalised knee distance is approximately 2.40, indicating potential lateral deviation when initiating the lift.
  - **Recommendation:** Ensure knees are aligned over the toes while maintaining weight distribution over the mid-foot. Focus on sending hips back effectively during setup.
  
- **Wrist Imbalance:** 
  - **Issue:** The normalised wrist difference measures around 1.61, suggesting an imbalance where one wrist is notably positioned further out than the other.
  - **Recommendation:** Achieve a more symmetrical grip by adjusting hand placement on the bar. Training with lighter weights can help in correcting hand spacing.

- **Right Knee Tracking:** 
  - **Issue:** The right knee lateral distance is approximately 1.27, tracking excessively outside the bar's line.
  - **Recommendation:** Engage lats actively and brace the core to stabilize knee positioning relative to the bar, preventing excessive flare during lift initiation.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Deviation During Lift:** 
  - **Issue:** Although knee distance is relatively symmetrical (2.408), the right side shows slight bias, indicating imbalanced push-off mechanics.
  - **Recommendation:** Adjust stance for equal weight distribution across both feet during the initial pull.

- **Right Knee Positioning:** 
  - **Issue:** The right knee is positioned marginally further away from the center line (1.148) during lift progress, affecting balance and efficiency.
  - **Recommendation:** Maintain alignment of knees under hips throughout the lift, correcting any deviation of the right knee towards the center.

- **Wrist Positioning & Stability:** 
  - **Issue:** A significant difference (2.843) between wrist positions at 90% lift progress suggests a rotational issue.
  - **Recommendation:** Focus on strengthening wrist stability and mobility, ensuring alignment of both wrists remains consistent through the lift.

- **Bar Path Consistency:** 
  - **Issue:** At full extension, the bar remains a distance of 23.124 cm from the body, indicating potential drift away from the center.
  - **Recommendation:** Reinforce cues to maintain the bar close to the body throughout the lift, which is crucial for maintaining balance and efficiency.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Symmetrical Positioning:** Focus on symmetry equally across setup and lift phases. This includes knee alignment, wrist positioning, and overall body structure.
- **Core Stability:** Continued emphasis on engaging core muscles can aid in maintaining stability and improving performance during lifts.
- **Regular Check-ins:** Utilize mirrors or video analysis during training sessions for ongoing feedback and correction of form.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Single-Leg Deadlifts:** To improve balance and address unilateral strength discrepancies.
- **Wrist Strengthening Exercises:** Such as wrist curls and grip work to improve wrist stability.
- **Core Stabilization Drills:** Incorporating exercises like planks and bird-dogs can enhance core strength, contributing to better stabilization during lifts.

This detailed report condenses the necessary feedback from both setup and pull analyses into actionable insights that can greatly improve lifting performance while minimizing injury risk."
