Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the Task: From my expertise, this task involves analyzing deadlift performance data specifically during the mid-lift phase to identify mechanics related to knee and hip extension alignment in the pull phase. Because the evaluation focuses on the left view, I will emphasize the sagittal plane and ignore any frontal plane asymmetries. Key variables include joint angles, their functional significance, and how they affect the mechanics of the lift until full extension. 

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task: I will analyze the joint angles provided in the knowledge base to assess their alignment and function during the mid-lift phase. After this analysis, I will summarize findings in a bullet point format, focusing on specific checkpoints such as knee flexion, hip extension, and overall body alignment. Each point will include observations about performance and recommendations for improvement. 

3. Addressing Challenges: One challenge might be slight variations in metrics due to YOLO model inference. I will take these variations into account and focus on the overall trends and interpretations rather than absolute values. I will ensure that my recommendations are actionable and practical, given these slight variances. 

4. Use of Available Tools: I will utilize the tool to create a structured output of findings in the specified JSON format. This tool will help me generate and refine my observations and recommendations efficiently. 

5. Expected Outcome: The expected output will contain four detailed checkpoints focusing on joint angles and hip/knee extension mechanics during the pull phase. This aligns with my primary goal of diagnosing techniques and providing corrective feedback to improve performance. The JSON output will be clear and structured for easy communication to athletes or coaches. This ensures clarity and focus on the subject matter at hand, which is essential for effective coaching.

Overall, I feel prepared and organized to execute this task well, utilizing my expertise and the provided tools effectively.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
