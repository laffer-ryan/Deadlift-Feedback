Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: This task focuses on analyzing deadlift performance data from a frontal view, specifically concerning the pull phase until full extension. My goal is to evaluate joint distances and inter-joint slopes to provide recommendations for improving technique. 

2. Key steps to complete the task:
   - Review the provided joint distance measurements to understand their implications for deadlift performance.
   - Analyze the slope comparisons between relevant joint distances to evaluate symmetry and technique.
   - Extract significant checkpoints regarding the pull phase, particularly focusing on knee and hip mechanics.
   - Identify any deviations or inefficiencies in movement and provide targeted recommendations to enhance the deadlift technique.

3. Approach to challenges: Should any data seem inconsistent due to slight variations from the YOLO model, I'll rely on my experience to distinguish significant deviations from normal ranges based on biomechanics principles. I will emphasize functional movement patterns over strict numerical criteria, given the nature of the data capture.

4. Tool use: I will use the functions available to create a JSON list summarizing findings with specific checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations. This approach ensures I format my analysis clearly and in line with the expected outcomes. 

5. Expected outcome: I anticipate delivering a structured and insightful JSON output that summarizes critical aspects of the evaluation while aligning with my overarching goal of improving the deadlift technique.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
