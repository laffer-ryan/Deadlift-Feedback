Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the Task: My task is to evaluate the deadlift performance using Phase 2 metrics from a side view. This evaluation involves analyzing joint angles (hip, knee, and potentially shoulder) and how they all relate during the pull phase of the deadlift. I will summarize findings, provide corrective feedback, and create actionable recommendations based on this evaluation.

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:
   - Collect joint angles and relevant metrics from the deadlift Phase 2 data provided in the KNOWLEDGE BASE.
   - Analyze joint angles focusing on hip and knee extension, documenting how these angles affect the lift.
   - Identify key checkpoints that influence the deadlift performance (e.g., angle at knees, angle at hips, and torso angle).
   - Formulate observations based on the angles and distances recorded.
   - Develop recommendations for improving pull technique, focusing specifically on alignment and extension of the hip and knee joints until full extension.

3. Approach to Challenges: Challenges may include variations in metrics due to equipment or data capturing conditions. I will be thorough in examining these variations and acknowledge slight changes as normal. By focusing on the patterns and overall trends instead of averaging immediate discrepancies, I can provide sound guidance.

4. Using Available Tools: I will utilize the functions API to parallelly process multiple evaluations, synthesizing my observations and recommendations into a structured format as specified. The output will be formatted as a JSON object containing the checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations for each evaluated point.

5. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a detailed JSON list of observations and recommendations that clearly align with effective deadlift technique. This aligns with my goals of ensuring safe and efficient lifting techniques for practitioners, contributing to their overall performance and strength development.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
