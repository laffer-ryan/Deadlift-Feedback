Reasoning Plan:
1. Collect Performance Data: Gather distance and angle measurements for key joints from the front view of the deadlift to assess the setup, lift-off, and initial pull in Phase 1 of the deadlift. 

2. Analyze Joint Positioning: Analyze the collected data focusing on the following three key checkpoints:
   - Checkpoint 1: Foot placement and angle of the knees with respect to the toes.
   - Checkpoint 2: Position of the hips relative to the knees and shoulders; determining whether the back is flat or rounded.
   - Checkpoint 3: Grip position on the barbell, including hand width and bar height relative to the shins. 

3. Identify Deviations: Examine the measurements for each checkpoint to identify major issues such as improper stance, misaligned joints, or an incorrect grip that can lead to poor lifting mechanics and increased risk of injury.

4. Develop Recommendations: Based on the analysis, develop individualized recommendations for:  
   - Stance: Recommend foot width and angle that best suits the individual's biomechanics. 
   - Grip: Suggest appropriate grip width and position for optimal lift-off. 
   - Body Alignment: Provide tips for ensuring that the hips, shoulders, and back are correctly aligned to promote effective lifting mechanics. 

5. Use Corrective Techniques: Recommend corrective techniques such as drills or exercises to practice the proper setup and lift-off in a controlled environment before attempting heavier lifts.

6. Feedback and Monitoring: Establish a feedback loop for ongoing assessment of these mechanics during training sessions to ensure continual improvement and adjustment based on progress.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques
