Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding the Task**: As an elite strength coach specializing in deadlift techniques, my role is to analyze joint angles and distances provided in the data from the left side view of a deadlift. I will focus on the setup and initial phases, noting any biomechanics that affect performance and safety.

2. **Key Steps for Completion**: 
   - **Review Data**: I will carefully analyze the metrics and angles provided for the joint in question.
   - **Identify Issues**: Examine the angles for conformity with best practices in deadlift mechanics, such as hip hinge, knee positioning, and back alignment during setup and liftoff.
   - **Make Recommendations**: Based on observed deviations, I will provide actionable insights aimed at correcting the setup and initial pull.
   - **Summarize Findings**: I will format my observations and recommendations into a structured JSON response according to the specified format.

3. **Challenges Consideration**: There may be slight variations due to measurement errors or individual differences in biomechanics. Therefore, I will focus on the most significant metrics that could influence overall technique and performance.

4. **Tool Usage**: I will use the tool designed for creating structured outputs to generate the JSON list. I will prepare outputs that detail the checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations derived from a profound understanding of biomechanics and strength training techniques.

5. **Expected Outcome**: The outcome will be a detailed JSON list with vital points of feedback for the practitioner. This will provide clear insights into their deadlift setup and initial pull, supporting improvements in form and performance.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques

    {
        "checkpoint": "Setup Phase",
        "metric": "Left Hip Angle",
        "observation": "The left hip angle is recorded at 53.75 degrees, indicating a potential lack of hip hinge. This angle is relatively sharp and suggests that the hips are not positioned optimally for the lift.",
        "recommendation": "Ensure the hips are pushed back to create a greater hip hinge. Aim for a hip angle closer to 45 degrees to promote proper leverage while lifting."

        "checkpoint": "Lift-off",
        "metric": "Bar Distance from Body",
        "observation": "The bar distance from the body at the lift-off is 1.08807 meters, which is too far from the center of mass. This could lead to increased strain on the back and potential forward lean.",
        "recommendation": "Adjust the bar position to be closer to the body, ideally within a hand's width from the shins at setup to ensure proper mechanical advantage during the initial pull."
    },
    {
        "checkpoint": "Initial Pull",
        "metric": "Left Knee Angle",
        "observation": "The left knee angle is at 99.37 degrees during the initial pull, indicating that the knees might not be positioned adequately to assist in the engagement of the posterior chain.",
        "recommendation": "Start with a slightly more pronounced knee flexion, aiming for a knee angle between 90 and 95 degrees to effectively engage the glutes and hamstrings during the initial phase of the lift."
