Reasoning Plan:
1. I will synthesize the feedback from the setup and pull phases of the deadlift, ensuring that shared metrics are highlighted and that impactful observations are emphasized.
2. The key areas for improvement will be grouped by phase, allowing for easier understanding of how issues in the setup can translate into problems during the lift. Each finding from both the setup and pull phases will be distilled into clear and precise language that coaches and athletes can understand and implement. 
3. Additionally, I'd provide specific recommendations aimed at improving technique and reducing injury risk, following a logical progression derived from the analysis of the data provided. 
4. The report will also explore accessory exercises tailored to address observed limiting factors, where applicable, ensuring that each suggestion aligns with the identified coordination and strength issues. 
5. By leveraging the available tools effectively, I anticipate that this structured markdown report will clearly present the findings resulting in actionable insights for athletes seeking to improve their deadlift performance while minimizing injury risk.  
Finally, I will verify the clarity and cohesion of the report before finalizing it to ensure it effectively communicates the analysis to the intended audience.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift
", status="completed", output="## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
The overall deadlift performance indicates several areas of concern, particularly with respect to balance, alignment, and symmetry during the setup and pull phases. Specifically, issues such as wide shoulder positioning, excessive lateral shifts in both ankles and knees, and asymmetrical wrist positioning may lead to reduced efficiency and increased risk of injury.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Lift-off: Normalised Shoulder Distance (1.28699)**  
  Wide shoulder positioning which may affect balance. 
- **Lift Progress Up (50%): Normalised Ankle Difference (2.77025)**  
  Indicates excessive lateral ankle displacement compromising stability. 
- **Lift Progress Up (60%): Normalised Knee Distance (2.3812)**  
  Shows alteration in knee alignment, causing excessive lateral shift.

**Pull Phase**
- **Lift Progress Up (70%): Left-Right Wrist Slope (0.148661)**  
  Positive slope indicates asymmetrical pull with the left wrist higher than the right.
- **Lift Progress Up (80%): Normalised Knee Distance (1.5797)**  
  Beginning to narrow, compromising power generation and stability.
- **Lift Progress Up (90%): Normalised Ankle Difference (1.89957)**  
  A relatively high value suggests a right-side bias that could affect balance.
- **Full Extension: Head Tilt Slope (-0.0143464)**  
  Negative slope indicates potential forward head tilt, which can lead to back misalignment.

**Overall Recommendations**
- Narrow the shoulder width slightly during setup to improve balance and alignment, targeting a normalised shoulder distance closer to 1.25.
- Maintain square and aligned feet throughout the lift-off to reduce lateral ankle movement, aiming for an ankle difference of less than 2.5.
- Keep knees aligned over toes without excessive inward or outward shift, aiming for a knee distance closer to 2.0 for better tracking.
- Focus on maintaining wrist symmetry during the pull by engaging both sides to prevent uneven tension.
- Ensure knees remain aligned with the feet throughout the lift to optimize force application.
- Distribute weight evenly between feet and push through heels to minimise lateral ankle differences.
- Maintain a neutral head position; focus on a slight forward gaze to keep head aligned with the spine.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Shoulder Mobility Work**: Incorporate shoulder mobility exercises like band pull-aparts or wall angels to improve range of motion and help achieve optimal shoulder positioning during setup.
- **Ankle Stability Drills**: Use exercises like single-leg balances or ankle dorsiflexion drills to enhance ankle stability and strength, reducing lateral shifts.
- **Knee Alignment Techniques**: Implement banded squat variations to ensure proper squat mechanics, which can translate to better knee alignment during the deadlift.
- **Isolated Wrist Strengthening**: Wrist curls and forearm exercises can help develop symmetry and strength in wrist positioning during pulls.

By integrating these recommendations and focusing on the outlined areas of improvement, the lifter can enhance their overall deadlift technique, increase efficiency, and reduce the risk of injury."
