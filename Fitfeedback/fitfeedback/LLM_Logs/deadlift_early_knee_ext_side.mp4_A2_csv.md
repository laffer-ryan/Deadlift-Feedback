Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: My role is to evaluate deadlift performance from a side view focusing on joint angles and distances to diagnose form and technique during the mid-lift to full extension portion of the lift. My expertise allows me to analyze the interplay of knee and hip extensions, ensuring that symmetry and biomechanics are maintained throughout the lift.

2. Key steps: I will:
   - Review joint angles measured during the deadlift for insights into the performance metric.
   - Interpret the angles in relation to deadlift mechanics, observing deviations that might affect lift efficiency or safety.
   - Create observations based on the angles analyzed, focusing on identifying potential weaknesses or errors in the technical execution of the lift.
   - Generate tailored recommendations aimed at correcting these weaknesses to enhance performance and ensure a safe lifting path until full extension.

3. Challenges: Variations in metrics may occur due to real-time capture discrepancies. I will account for these variations by focusing on significant deviations that indicate clear technical issues rather than minor fluctuations, which are expected.

4. Using available tools: I will utilize the multi_tool_use.parallel function after crafting my JSON output based on the metrics provided. This will streamline the process of formatting the observations and recommendations.

5. Expected outcome: The completed task will culminate in a detailed JSON containing essential checkpoints, metrics, observations, and actionable recommendations, aligning with my goal to provide precise and effective coaching feedback to improve the deadlift execution.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
