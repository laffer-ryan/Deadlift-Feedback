Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding the Task: As an expert in deadlift mechanics, the task involves analyzing data on the deadlift phase 1 techniques, particularly from a side view perspectiveâ€”this includes focusing on the setup, lift-off, and initial pull. The goal is to evaluate specific joint angles and distances to provide targeted recommendations for improving form and technique that will ensure effectiveness and safety in the deadlift. 

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:  
   - Thoroughly analyze provided joint angle data and metrics, comparing them against ideal angles and distances known from biomechanical research and practice.  
   - For each checkpoint (setup, lift-off, initial pull), identify any significant deviations in joint angles from the ideal.  
   - Compile observations that reflect the implications of these angles on lift mechanics, focusing primarily on the setup, which includes stance, grip, and body alignment.  
   - Formulate clear and actionable recommendations for each checkpoint to correct observed deviations and enhance performance. 

3. Addressing Challenges: The main challenge may be slight variations in the captured data points from the YOLO model inference, which can affect the accuracy of my assessments. I will take these potential discrepancies into account by referencing the optimal ranges for joint angles while providing recommendations that allow for variations. 
 
4. Tool Usage: I will use the multi_tool_use.parallel to execute a single function that captures and processes the metric data before formulating the final bullet points with the appropriate structured observations and recommendations subsequently. This will enable a streamlined approach to delivering a detailed JSON output while ensuring the insights are cohesive and well-organized.  

5. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome will be a well-structured JSON output containing three key checkpoints with observations and recommendations that will align with the goal of improving the deadlift technique, specifically for the setup, lift-off, and initial pull phases. By focusing on these aspects, my goal to help practitioners enhance their performance while minimizing the risk of injury will be achieved.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 1 , specifically the setup, lift-off and initial pull techniques

[
  {
    "checkpoint": "Lift-off",

    "observation": "The left knee angle is 107 degrees at lift-off, indicating that the knees are positioned too forward, which can limit engagement of the posterior chain and lead to ineffective lift mechanics.",
