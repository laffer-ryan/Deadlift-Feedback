Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the Task: From my professional perspective, the task requires an in-depth analysis of a deadlift performance from a side view, specifically during the pull phase up to full extension. This involves evaluating joint angles related to hip and knee extension to ensure proper technique and performance. The emphasis will be on identifying any deviations from optimal form and making evidence-based recommendations for correction. 

2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:  
   - Access the joint angle and distance data related to the deadlift’s pull phase from the side view.  
   - Analyze the joint angles for the hip and knee, focusing on their extension during the lift.  
   - Identify any common deviations or faults that may impact the deadlift efficiency and safety.  
   - Based on the analysis, provide clear and actionable recommendations to improve the deadlift technique.  
   - Prepare a structured JSON output that includes four checkpoints summarizing key findings and corrective actions. 

3. Approach to Potential Challenges: In analyzing the data, variations in metrics may occur due to the limitations of the capture method (YOLO model). It's essential to assess the data with an understanding of normal variation ranges. I will rely on my expertise in biomechanics to make effective evaluations despite these variations. 

4. Strategic Use of Tools: I will use the provided functions to create a reasoning plan first. The tool allows me to set up my thought process, which helps ensure all considerations are documented before executing the analysis. Thereafter, I will utilize multi_tool_use to analyze individual joint metrics based on the findings and return a structured JSON output. 

5. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a thorough evaluation of the deadlift techniques focusing on the pull phase, complete with a breakdown of four critical checkpoints for correction. This aligns with my goal as it will address common issues in deadlift performance, providing clear insights and recommendations for practitioners to optimize their lifts.
