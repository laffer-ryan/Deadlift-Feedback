Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: The task involves evaluating a deadlift performance from a side view, focusing specifically on the mid-lift phase until full extension. This requires a thorough analysis of joint angles and their implications on the efficiency and safety of the lift based on the biomechanics of the deadlift.

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Evaluation**:  
   - Review the provided performance data focused on joint angles relative to the pull phase. 
   - Identify ideal angles for knee and hip joints and assess the observed angles against these standards. 
   - Note any discrepancies, such as deviations from the optimal degrees that could affect lift performance and safety. 
   - Formulate specific recommendations based on these observations to improve the technique, ensuring a clean transition from mid-lift to full extension without compromising form.  

3. **Approach to Challenges**: Challenges may include interpreting slight variations in the joint data from the YOLO model inference. My experience in biomechanics and familiarity with typical deviations will help in accurately analyzing such nuances. Additionally, ensuring that recommendations are clear and actionable will be critical. 

4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools**: The primary tool needed will be the functions tool for creating the detailed JSON output based on the observations and recommendations derived from the analysis. Since I need to format the output into a structured JSON format, I will carefully structure my findings. 

5. **Expected Outcome**: The outcome will include four well-defined checkpoints outlining critical metrics, observations, and actionable recommendations, helping the lifter refine their deadlift technique during the phase 2 mid-lift process. This aligns perfectly with my goal of optimizing the lift performance and enhancing safety.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
