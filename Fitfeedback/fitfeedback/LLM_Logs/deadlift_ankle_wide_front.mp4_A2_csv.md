Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: As a Deadlift Expert specializing in mid-lift techniques, my goal is to evaluate the deadlift performance data from the front view, focusing on Phase 2 mechanics. This involves analyzing available joint measurements, understanding inter-joint distances, and their implications on the movement, and making recommendations to enhance performance. 

2. Key steps to complete the task: 
   - Analyze the frontal view data focusing on pull technique and inter-joint distances relating to knee and hip extension. 
   - Identify deviations in form and technique that can impact the overall effectiveness and safety of the deadlift. 
   - Develop logical recommendations for improvement based on biomechanical principles. 
   - Summarize findings in a structured JSON format with key points related to checkpoints, metrics, observations, and recommendations. 

3. Approach to challenges: I will leverage my knowledge of biomechanics to ensure that even slight variations are recognized but do not lead to misleading conclusions. My experience allows me to identify minor deviations and their significance. I will be attentive to maintaining the focus on joint mechanics instead of angles since the angle data is unavailable. 

4. Usage of available tools: I will use the create_reasoning_plan tool to outline my plan and prepare for execution. Once the plan is confirmed, I will run the evaluation using the multi_tool_use.parallel to analyze joint distances and slopes in conjunction with metrics from the frontal view performance data. 

5. Expected outcome: I anticipate generating a detailed JSON output comprising 4 actionable bullet points assessing the deadlift performance and providing clear recommendations. This outcome aligns with my goal of enhancing the technical execution and overall safety of the lift for practitioners.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
