Reasoning Plan:
1. As a Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach, I understand that my primary focus is on Phase 2 of the deadlift, specifically how the technique affects the alignment of hip and knee extension during the pull phase. I need to analyze the provided joint distance and angle measurements from a frontal view, concentrating on the relationships between these measurements, particularly during the mid-lift to full extension mechanics.

2. Key steps to complete the task:
   - Thoroughly evaluate the deadlift performance data utilizing the joint metrics (specifically distance and inter-joint slopes) given in the knowledge base.
   - Focus on assessing the pull phase leading up to full extension, targeting potential imbalances in the hip-knee relationship.
   - Identify any deviations from ideal deadlift posture observed in the frontal view data.
   - Formulate clear corrective feedback which allows practitioners to improve their technique.

3. I will be vigilant for challenges, such as distorted data from discrepancies and slight variations, and ensure I contextualize my observations accordingly. I will rely on my experience to interpret the metrics carefully and communicate them effectively.

4. I'll use the functions to create a detailed summary of findings with specific checkpoints to help practitioners understand the areas for improvement. I will cross-reference metrics from the knowledge base and extract the most relevant observations focused on posture and alignment issues relevant to the frontal view. The end goal is to return a structured JSON output.

5. The expected outcome is a comprehensive review that aligns with my aim to enhance liftersâ€™ performance and safety during the deadlift, ultimately aiding in their progression and technique symmetry. This output should provide actionable insights for practitioners, driving them further along their strength journey.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in deadlift phase 2 (mid lift) techniques
