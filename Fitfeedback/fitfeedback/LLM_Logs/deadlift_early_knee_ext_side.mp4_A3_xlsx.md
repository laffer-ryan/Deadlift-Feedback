Reasoning Plan:
1. The task involves analyzing performance data regarding the deadlift from both setup and pull phases, with a focus on effective integration of key metrics and recommendations for improvement.

2. I will start by understanding the critical observations and areas needing improvement based on the provided performance data. I will then synthesize the findings from both the setup and pull phases, filtering for the most impactful feedback to ensure clarity for both the coach and the athlete. 

3. I anticipate possible challenges in combining insights that may seem conflicting or redundant. I will utilize my expertise to identify the core issues that resonate across both phases, thereby streamlining the report for optimal communication.

4. I will use the expected output structure to guide the creation of the report. I will compile the findings in Markdown format to ensure readability and effectiveness, focusing on grouping areas for improvement by phases (setup, pull, overall). I will also include specific recommendations and optional accessory exercises based on the identified limitations. The functions tool will be instrumental in generating a concise report that aligns with my expertise and delivers actionable insights. 

5. The outcome will be a detailed, structured report that provides in-depth insights into the deadlift performance, emphasizing corrections and recommendations for improved technique and injury prevention. This aligns with my goal to provide a comprehensive analysis that coaches can readily use for their clients' progress.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift

**Movement Summary:**  
The analysis of the deadlift performance from the left view reveals critical insights into setup and pull phases. Several adjustments are evident in knee and hip angles during lift-off, which may influence the entire lift's efficiency and risk of injury. 

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Bar Position**: The bar is positioned 11.28 cm from the body, which is relatively close but could be improved to reduce strain on the lower back.
- **Knee Angle**: The left knee angle is 107.20 degrees, indicating it is too far forward during the lift-off phase, potentially leading to instability.
- **Hip Angle**: The left hip angle measures 56.38 degrees, suggesting a weak position for an initial pull.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Angle**: At lift-off, the left knee angle is at 107.20°, a slight flexion that may hinder optimal hip extension.
- **Hip Drive**: Although the left hip angle improves, it remains at 177.83°, indicating insufficient hip drive.
- **Bar Path**: The bar distance from the body increases from 11.28 cm at lift-off to 40.50 cm at 50%, indicating the bar is moving away from the optimal path.
- **Neck Position**: The neck angle at full extension is recorded at 132.74°, potentially indicating excessive forward positioning of the head.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Knee Position**: Aim to keep the knees positioned back behind the bar during the lift-off and throughout the pull phase to engage the posterior chain effectively.
- **Hip Position**: Adjust the initial setup to place the hips slightly higher than the knees, allowing for stronger engagement of the glutes and hamstrings.
- **Bar Path**: Focus on maintaining a close bar path to the body throughout the lift to enhance leverage and reduce strain on the back.
- **Neck Alignment**: Ensure the neck remains neutral, maintaining a forward gaze to support spinal alignment and promote efficient upward movement.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Romanian Deadlifts**: To strengthen the hamstrings and glutes, improving the strength of the posterior chain.
- **Hip Thrusts**: To specifically target glute strength and hip drive, enhancing the power output during the pull phase.
- **Front Squats**: To promote better knee positioning and core stability, translating improvements into the deadlift.

Implementing these corrections and additional exercises will not only improve lift performance but will also reduce the risk of injury over time."
