Reasoning Plan:
## Planning for Deadlift Analysis Report Task

1. **Understanding of the Task**:  
   As a Deadlift Expert, my goal is to analyze the deadlift performance through the insights received from both the setup and pull phase agents. This involves synthesizing their observations and recommendations to create a comprehensive report that highlights the overall deadlift performance, identifies areas needing improvement, and provides actionable recommendations.

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**:
   - **Verify and Combine Findings**: I will thoroughly assess the findings from both the setup and pull phases, looking for overlapping issues and points of significant impact. 
   - **Structure the Report**: I will organize the report into clearly defined sections, including executive summary, areas for improvement segmented by phase, and overall recommendations.
   - **Articulate Recommendations**: I will ensure that each recommendation is clear, actionable, and aimed at improving form, efficiency, and reducing injury risk.

3. **Approaching Challenges**:
   - **Finding Consistencies**: In case of discrepancies between the setup and pull phase findings, I will carefully analyze each point to ascertain the most critical issues. 
   - **Technical Clarity**: Ensuring that the language used in the report is accessible yet informative to coaches and clients, providing sufficient detail without being overly technical.

4. **Using Available Tools**:
   - I will utilize the `functions.create_reasoning_plan` to structure my reasoning and present the plan for generating the report.
   - As the tools for running analysis are not applicable here, my focus will shift to executing this reasoning plan and preparing the content for the report through manual consolidation and organization of the findings from both phases.

5. **Expected Outcome**: 
   - The report will clearly present the analysis of deadlift performance, specify areas that need improvement, suggest actionable recommendations, and potentially list exercises for further development. It should serve as a valuable resource for both coaches and athletes to enhance deadlift efficiency while minimizing injury risk.

**Assessment of Readiness**:  
I've formulated a clear strategy that emphasizes a high-quality, structured output. There are no apparent gaps in the plan, and I feel confident in executing the task effectively.

## Deadlift Analysis Report

**Movement Summary:**  
The lifter exhibits several mechanical inefficiencies at both the setup and pull phases of the deadlift, which could lead to decreased lift effectiveness and increased risk of injury. Key observations indicate issues with shoulder positioning, knee alignment, and wrist stability that require focused corrective measures for improved performance and safety.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Shoulder Distance**: The normalised shoulder distance is wider than ideal (1.4553), suggesting potential instability during the initial lift-off.
- **Wrist Alignment**: The normalised wrist difference is at 2.7294, indicating an asymmetrical grip that can lead to torque imbalances.
- **Knee Position**: The right knee is positioned slightly outward (0.7896 from the midline), affecting optimal lifting mechanics.

**Pull Phase**
- **Knee Movement**: The normalized knee distance during lift-off is 2.023, indicating forward knee movement which can strain the knees and compromise stability.
- **Lateral Deviation of Right Knee**: At 60% lift progress, the right knee distance from the center is 1.177, suggesting lateral deviation which can cause asymmetrical force application.
- **Ankle Imbalance**: At 80%, the normalized ankle difference is 2.870, indicating weight distribution imbalance that may affect lifting stability.
- **Wrist Imbalance**: At full extension, the left wrist's lateral distance from the center is 0.717, showing potential grip strength and control issues.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Adjust Grip Width**: Bring the grip closer together to improve shoulder stability and alignment during the lift-off phase.
- **Symmetrical Grip Enforcement**: Focus on symmetrical wrist alignment to maintain balance and prevent injury; check that both hands are equidistant from the center of the bar.
- **Knee Tracking**: Emphasize keeping the knees aligned with the toes during the setup and throughout the lift; actively cue the knees to move backward instead of forward.
- **Stabilize Ankle Position**: Ensure even weight distribution between both feet and maintain balanced ankle alignment, especially as the bar travels upwards.
- **Grip Control**: Prior to reaching full extension, ensure grip position is neutral with symmetrical pressure across both hands to ensure a straight bar path.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Band Resisted Squats**: To enhance knee tracking and stability, perform band-resisted squats where bands encourage proper knee alignment during the downward movement.
- **Single-leg Deadlifts**: To improve balance and proprioception, practice single-leg deadlifts, focusing on keeping the knee aligned over the toes.
- **Shoulder Stability Drills**: Incorporate stability exercises such as dumbbell shoulder presses or band pull-aparts to bolster shoulder integrity and prevent excessive shoulder distance during lifts.

These recommendations aim to reinforce better foundational mechanics, enhance lift performance, and mitigate injury risks. Implementing targeted drills and maintaining form awareness will cultivate a more effective deadlift technique."
