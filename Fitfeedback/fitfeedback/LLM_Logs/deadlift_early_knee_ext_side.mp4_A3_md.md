Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task**: I need to create a structured report that consolidates and synthesizes findings from both the deadlift setup and pull phase analyses. Each observation and recommendation will be assessed and categorized for easy comprehension by a coach or physical trainer. My goal is to focus on the most impactful insights to improve the lifter's overall performance, efficiency, and injury prevention. 

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**: 
   - Review the setup and pull phase feedback thoroughly to identify common themes or overlapping issues. 
   - Categorize findings into their respective phases, ensuring clarity in the reports of both setup and pull phases. 
   - Summarize overarching themes that apply to both phases and suggest actionable recommendations to improve performance. 
   - If necessary, incorporate accessory exercises that target specific limitations identified during the analysis. 
   - Format the report using clear markdown for easy reading and accessibility. 

3. **Approach to Challenges**: I will ensure that both the observations and recommendations are critically evaluated for their relevance and applicability. If I find discrepancies between the two phases, I will assess which findings have the greatest impact on performance and prioritize those. 

4. **Utilization of Tools**: I will utilize the multi_tool_use.parallel function to run the necessary tools and collect insights efficiently. The data from both the setup and pull agents will be consolidated, crafting a final report that reflects integrated findings.

5. **Expected Outcome**: The end product will be a comprehensive and coherent deadlift analysis report that highlights strengths and weaknesses in the lifter’s performance. It will include specific recommendations for technique adjustments and outlines possible accessory exercises when limitations are identified. 

The required tools and integrations will set me up for a clear analysis and generate this report accurately. It will serve to aid in the coaching process and track improvement effectively.", agent="Deadlift Expert Olympic Lifting Physical Trainer and Coach specializing in efficiently synchronising joint movements; integrating lower, middle, and upper body analysis for deadlift

**Movement Summary:**  
The lifter demonstrates significant points of inefficiency during both the setup and pull phases of the deadlift. Key issues with body positioning and alignment are present, which may hinder performance and increase the risk of injury. Attention to joint angles and bar positioning will lead to improvements in power output and overall stability.

### Areas for Improvement

**Setup Phase**
- **Bar Distance from Body**: At lift-off, the bar is recorded at 41.96 cm from the body, indicating that the hips may be positioned too high. This leads to an inefficient start.
- **Knee Angle Tracking**: The left knee angle is recorded at 163.34 degrees, suggesting it is not tracking forward over the toes, impeding effective leg engagement.
- **Hip Angle**: The left hip angle of 57.28 degrees indicates excessive rounding of the back, suggesting a lack of proper posterior chain engagement.

**Pull Phase**
- **Bar Distance from Body**: The distance is recorded at 8.50 cm, which is significantly improved but still indicates potential inconsistency during the pull, combined with a knee angle of 113.14 degrees that limits tension in the posterior chain.
- **Knee and Hip Angles**: Matched findings indicate insufficient alignment, with the knee angle at 156.76 degrees contributing to reduced power production and back position inefficiencies.
- **Overall Alignment**: Continued issues with joint alignment are present, especially at the torso projection stages, where angles suggest that both hip and knee positions, especially at full extension, are not optimizing power transfer.

### Overall Recommendations
- **Adjustment of Setup Mechanics**: Lower the hips in the setup to ensure proper bar proximity and knee tracking. Engage the glutes and hamstrings for better posterior chain activation.
- **Focus on Joint Alignment during Pull**: Maintain knee flexion throughout the lift and ensure the knees move forward appropriately to enhance power generation from the legs. Aim for a consistent hip extension without locking the knees out prematurely.
- **Tension Maintenance**: Instruct the lifter to maintain slight knee flexion at full extension to preserve joint integrity and sustain musculature engagement.

### Accessory Exercise Suggestions
- **Hamstring Curls**: To strengthen and improve engagement of the hamstrings during the initial pull.
- **Hip Thrusts**: To enhance the power of the posterior chain and ensure proper hip extension mechanics during lifts.
- **Kettlebell Swings**: To improve explosive hip drive and overall coordination between the lower and upper body, helping to reinforce the connection during the deadlift.

By addressing these key areas, the lifter will improve their deadlifting capability, increase strength output, and decrease the likelihood of injury. Implementing these changes consistently will lead to overall progress in performance."
